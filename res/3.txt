   TO THE MOST HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE JAMES, BY THE GRACE OF GOD,


   KING OF GREAT BRITIAN, FRANCE, AND IRELAND,


   DEFENDER OF THE FAITH, ETC.


   THE TRANSLATORS OF THE BIBLE WISH GRACE, MERCY, AND PEACE,


   THROUGH JESUS CHRIST OUR Lord


   Great and manifold were the blessings, most dread Sovereign, which
   Almighty God, the Father of all mercies, bestowed upon us the people of
   England, when first he sent Your Majesty's Royal Person to rule and
   reign over us. For whereas it was the expectation of many, who wished
   not well unto our Sion, that, upon the setting of that bright
   Occindental Star, Queen Elizabeth, of most happy memory, some thick and
   palpable clouds of darkness would so have overshadowed this land, that
   men should have been in doubt which way they were to walk, and that it
   should hardly be known who was to direct the unsettled State; the
   appearance of Your Majesty, as of the Sun in his strength, instantly
   dispelled those supposed and surmised mists, and gave unto all that
   were well affected exceeding cause of comfort; especially when we
   beheld the Government established in Your Highness, and Your hopeful
   Seed, by an undoubted Title; and this also accompanied with peace and
   tranquillity at home and abroad.

   But among all of our joys, there was no one that more filled our hearts
   than the blessed continuance of the preaching of God's sacred Word
   among us, which is that inestimable treasure which excelleth all the
   riches of the earth; because the fruit thereof extendeth itself, not
   only to the time spent in this transitory world, but directeth and
   disposeth men unto that eternal happiness which is above in heaven.

   Then not to suffer this fall to the ground, but rather to take it up,
   and to continue it in that state wherein the famous Predecessor of Your
   Highness did leave it; nay, to go forward with the confidence and
   resolution of a man, in maintaining the truth of Christ, and
   propagating it far and near is that which hath so bound and firmly knit
   the hearts of all Your Majesty's loyal and religious people unto You,
   that Your very name is precious among them: their eye doth behold You
   with comfort, and they bless You in their hearts, as that sanctified
   Person, who, under God, is the immediate author of their true
   happiness. And this their contentment doth not diminish or decay, but
   every day increaseth and taketh strength, when they observe that the
   zeal of Your Majesty toward the house of God doth not slack or go
   backward, but is more and more kindled, manifesting itself abroad in
   the farthest parts of Christendom, by writing in defence of the truth,
   (which hath given such a blow unto that Man of Sin as will not be
   healed,) and every day at home, by religious and learned discourse, by
   frequenting the house of God, by hearing the Word preached, by
   cherishing the teachers thereof, by caring for the Church, as a most
   tender and loving nursing father.

   There are infinite arguments of this right Christian and religious
   affection in Your Majesty; but none is more forcible to declare it to
   others than the vehement and perpetuated desire of accomplishing and
   publishing of this work, which now, with all humility, we present unto
   Your Majesty. For when Your Highness had once, out of deep judgement,
   apprehended how convenient it was, that, out of the Original sacred
   Tongues, together with comparing of the labours, both in our own and
   other foreign languages, of many worthy men who went before us, there
   should be one more exact translation of the Holy Scriptures into the
   English tongue; Your Majesty did never desist to urge and to excite
   those to whom it was commended, that the Work might be hastened, and
   that the business might be expedited in so decent a manner, as a matter
   of such importance might justly require.

   And now at last, by the mercy of God, and the continuance of our
   labours, it being brought unto such a conclusion, as that we have great
   hopes that the Church of England shall reap good fruit thereby, we hold
   it our duty to offer it to Your Majesty, not only as to our King and
   Sovereign, but as to the principal mover and author of the Work; humbly
   craving of your most Sacred Majesty, that, since things of this quality
   have ever been subject to the censures of ill-meaning and discontented
   persons, it may receive approbation and patronage from so learned and
   judicious a Prince as Your Highness is; whose allowance and acceptance
   of our labours shall more honour and encourage us, than all the
   calumniations and hard interpretations of other men shall dismay us. So
   that if, on the one side, we shall be traduced by Popish persons at
   home or abroad, who therefore will malign us, because we are poor
   instruments to make God's holy truth to be yet more and more known unto
   the people, whom they desire still to keep in ignorance and darkness;
   or if, on the other side, we shall be maligned by self-conceited
   brethren, who run their own ways, and give liking unto nothing but what
   is framed by themselves, and hammered on their anvil, we may rest
   secure, supported within by the truth and innocency of a good
   conscience, having walked the ways of simplicity and integrity, as
   before the Lord, and sustained without by the powerful protection of
   Your Majesty's grace and favour, which will ever give countenance to
   honest and Christian endeavours against bitter censures and
   uncharitable imputations.

   The Lord of heaven and earth bless Your Majesty with many and happy
   days, that, as his heavenly hand hath enriched Your Highness with many
   singular and extraordinary graces, so You may be the wonder of the
   world in this latter age for happiness and true felicity, to the honour
   of that great God, and the good of his Church, through Jesus Christ our
   Lord and only Saviour.

THE TRANSLATORS TO THE READER

  Preface to the King James Version of 1611

  THE BEST THINGS HAVE BEEN CULMINATED

   Zeal to promote the common good, whether it be by devising anything
   ourselves, or revising that which hath been laboured by others,
   deserveth certainly much respect and esteem, but yet findeth but cold
   entertainment in the world. It is welcomed with suspicion instead of
   love, and with emulation instead of thanks: and if there be any hole
   left for cavil to enter, (and cavil, if it do not find a hole, will
   make one) it is sure to be misconstrued, and in danger to be condemned.
   This will easily be granted by as many as know story, or have any
   experience. For, was there ever any-projected, that savoured any way of
   newness or renewing, but the same endured many a storm of gainsaying,
   or opposition? A man would think that Civility, wholesome Laws,
   learning and eloquence, Synods, and Church-maintenance, (that we speak
   of no more things of this kind) should be as safe as a Sanctuary, and
   out of shot, as they say, that no man would lift up the heel, no, nor
   dog move his tongue against the motioners of them. For by the first, we
   are distinguished from brute beasts lead with sensuality; By the
   second, we are bridled and restrained from outrageous behaviour, and
   from doing of injuries, whether by fraud or by violence; By the third,
   we are enabled to inform and reform others, by the light and feeling
   that we have attained unto ourselves; Briefly, by the fourth being
   brought together to a parley face to face, we sooner compose our
   differences than by writings which are endless; And lastly, that the
   Church be sufficiently provided for, is so agreeable to good reason and
   conscience, that those mothers are holden to be less cruel, that kill
   their children as soon as they are born, than those nursing fathers and
   mothers (wheresoever they be) that withdraw from them who hang upon
   their breasts (and upon whose breasts again themselves do hang to
   receive the Spiritual and sincere milk of the word) livelihood and
   support fit for their estates. Thus it is apparent, that these things
   which we speak of, are of most necessary use, and therefore, that none,
   either without absurdity can speak against them, or without note of
   wickedness can spurn against them.

   Yet for all that, the learned know that certain worthy men [Anacharsis
   with others] have been brought to untimely death for none other fault,
   but for seeking to reduce their Countrymen to god order and discipline;
   and that in some Commonwealths [e.g. Locri] it was made a capital
   crime, once to motion the making of a new Law for the abrogating of an
   old, though the same were most pernicious; And that certain [Cato the
   elder], which would be counted pillars of the State, and patterns of
   Virtue and Prudence, could not be brought for a long time to give way
   to good Letters and refined speech, but bare themselves as averse from
   them, as from rocks or boxes of poison; And fourthly, that he was no
   babe, but a great clerk [Gregory the Divine], that gave forth (and in
   writing to remain to posterity) in passion peradventure, but yet he
   gave forth, that he had not seen any profit to come by any Synod, or
   meeting of the Clergy, but rather the contrary; And lastly, against
   Church-maintenance and allowance, in such sort, as the Ambassadors and
   messengers of the great King of Kings should be furnished, it is not
   unknown what a fiction or fable (so it is esteemed, and for no better
   by the reporter himself [Nauclerus], though superstitious) was devised;
   Namely, that at such a time as the professors and teachers of
   Christianity in the Church of Rome, then a true Church, were liberally
   endowed, a voice forsooth was heard from heaven, saying: Now is poison
   poured down into the Church, etc. Thus not only as oft as we speak, as
   one saith, but also as oft as we do anything of note or consequence, we
   subject ourselves to everyone's censure, and happy is he that is least
   tossed upon tongues; for utterly to escape the snatch of them it is
   impossible. If any man conceit, that this is the lot and portion of the
   meaner sort only, and that Princes are privileged by their high estate,
   he is deceived. "As the sword devoureth as well one as the other," as
   it is in Samuel [2 Sam 11:25], nay as the great Commander charged his
   soldiers in a certain battle, to strike at no part of the enemy, but at
   the face; And as the King of Syria commanded his chief Captains to
   "fight neither with small nor great, save only against the King of
   Israel:" [1 Kings 22:31] so it is too true, that Envy striketh most
   spitefully at the fairest, and at the chiefest. David was a worthy
   Prince, and no man to be compared to him for his first deeds, and yet
   for as worthy as act as ever he did (even for bringing back the Ark of
   God in solemnity) he was scorned and scoffed at by his own wife [2 Sam
   6:16]. Solomon was greater than David, though not in virtue, yet in
   power: and by his power and wisdom he built a Temple to the Lord, such
   a one as was the glory of the land of Israel, and the wonder of the
   whole world. But was that his magnificence liked of by all? We doubt
   it. Otherwise, why do they lay it in his son's dish, and call unto him
   for easing the burden, "Make", say they, "the grievous servitude of thy
   father, and his sore yoke, lighter?" [1 Kings 12:4] Belike he had
   charged them with some levies, and troubled them with some carriages;
   Hereupon they raise up a tragedy, and wish in their heart the Temple
   had never been built. So hard a thing it is to please all, even when we
   please God best, and do seek to approve ourselves to every ones
   conscience.

   If we will descend to later times, we shall find many the like examples
   of such kind, or rather unkind acceptance. The first Roman Emperor [C.
   Caesar. Plutarch] did never do a more pleasing deed to the learned, nor
   more profitable to posterity, for conserving the record of times in
   true supputation; than when he corrected the Calendar, and ordered the
   year according to the course of the Sun; and yet this was imputed to
   him for novelty, and arrogance, and procured to him great obloguy. So
   the first Christened Emperor [Constantine] (at the least-wise that
   openly professed the faith himself, and allowed others to do the like)
   for strengthening the Empire at his great charges, and providing for
   the Church, as he did, got for his labour the name Pupillus, as who
   would say, a wasteful Prince, that had need of a Guardian or overseer
   [Aurel. Victor]. So the best Christened Emperor [Theodosius], for the
   love that he bare unto peace, thereby to enrich both himself and his
   subjects, and because he did not see war but find it, was judged to be
   no man at arms [Zosimus], (though indeed he excelled in feats of
   chivalry, and showed so much when he was provoked) and condemned for
   giving himself to his ease, and to his pleasure. To be short, the most
   learned Emperor of former times [Justinian], (at the least, the
   greatest politician) what thanks had he for cutting off the
   superfluities of the laws, and digesting them into some order and
   method? This, that he had been blotted by some to be an Epitomist, that
   is, one that extinguishes worthy whole volumes, to bring his
   abridgments into request. This is the measure that hath been rendered
   to excellent Princes in former times, even, Cum bene facerent, male
   audire, For their good deeds to be evil spoken of. Neither is there any
   likelihood, that envy and malignity died, and were buried with the
   ancient. No, no, the reproof of Moses taketh hold of most ages; "You
   are risen up in your fathers' stead, and increase of sinful men." [Num
   32:14] "What is that that hath been done? that which shall be done; and
   there is no new thing under the Sun," saith the wiseman: [Ecc 1:9] and
   S. Stephen, "As your fathers did, so do you." [Acts 7:51]

    HIS MAJESTY'S CONSTANCY, NOTWITHSTANDING CULMINATION, FOR THE SURVEY OF THE
    ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS

   This, and more to this purpose, His Majesty that now reigneth (and
   long, and long may he reign, and his offspring forever, "Himself and
   children, and children's always) knew full well, according to the
   singular wisdom given unto him by God, and the rare learning and
   experience that he hath attained unto; namely that whosoever attempteth
   anything for the public (especially if it pertain to Religion, and to
   the opening and clearing of the word of God) the same setteth himself
   upon a stage to be gloated upon by every evil eye, yea, he casteth
   himself headlong upon pikes, to be gored by every sharp tongue. For he
   that medleth with men's Religion in any part, medleth with their
   custom, nay, with their freehold; and though they find no content in
   that which they have, yet they cannot abide to hear of altering.
   Notwithstanding his Royal heart was not daunted or discouraged for this
   that colour, but stood resolute, "as a statue immovable, and an anvil
   not easy to be beaten into plates," as one [Suidas] saith; he knew who
   had chosen him to be a Soldier, or rather a Captain, and being assured
   that the course which he intended made for the glory of God, and the
   building up of his Church, he would not suffer it to be broken off for
   whatsoever speeches or practices. It doth certainly belong unto Kings,
   yea, it doth specially belong unto them, to have care of Religion, yea,
   it doth specially belong unto them, to have care of Religion, yea, to
   know it aright, yea, to profess it zealously, yea to promote it to the
   uttermost of their power. This is their glory before all nations which
   mean well, and this will bring unto them a far most excellent weight of
   glory in the day of the Lord Jesus. For the Scripture saith not in
   vain, "Them that honor me, I will honor," [1 Sam 2:30] neither was it a
   vain word that Eusebius delivered long ago, that piety towards God was
   the weapon and the only weapon, that both preserved Constantine's
   person, and avenged him of his enemies [Eusebius lib 10 cap 8].

    THE PRAISE OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES

   But now what piety without truth? what truth (what saving truth)
   without the word of God? What word of God (whereof we may be sure)
   without the Scripture? The Scriptures we are commanded to search. John
   5:39. Isa 8:20. They are commended that searched and studied them. Acts
   17:11 and 8:28,29. They are reproved that were unskillful in them, or
   slow to believe them. Matt 22:29. Luke 24:25. They can make us wise
   unto salvation. 2 Tim 3:15. If we be ignorant, they will instruct us;
   if out of the way, they will bring us home; if out of order, they will
   reform us; if in heaviness, comfort us; if dull, quicken us; if cold,
   inflame us. Tolle, lege; Tolle, lege, Take up and read, take up and
   read the Scriptures [S. August. confess. lib 8 cap 12], (for unto them
   was the direction) it was said unto S. Augustine by a supernatural
   voice. "Whatsoever is in the Scriptures, believe me," saith the same S.
   Augustine, "is high and divine; there is verily truth, and a doctrine
   most fit for the refreshing of men's minds, and truly so tempered, that
   everyone may draw from thence that which is sufficient for him, if he
   come to draw with a devout and pious mind, as true Religion requireth."
   [S. August. de utilitcredendi cap. 6] Thus S. Augustine. and S. Jerome:
   "Ama scripturas, et amabit te sapientia etc." [S. Jerome. ad Demetriad]
   Love the Scriptures, and wisdom will love thee. And S. Cyril against
   Julian; "Even boys that are bred up in the Scriptures, become most
   religious, etc. [S. Cyril. 7 contra Iulianum] But what mention we three
   or four uses of the Scripture, whereas whatsoever is to be believed or
   practiced, or hoped for, is contained in them? or three or four
   sentences of the Fathers, since whosoever is worthy the name of a
   Father, from Christ's time downward, hath likewise written not only of
   the riches, but also of the perfection of the Scripture? "I adore the
   fulness of the Scripture," saith Tertullian against Hermogenes.
   [Tertul. advers. Hermo.] And again, to Apelles an heretic of the like
   stamp, he saith; "I do not admit that which thou bringest in (or
   concludest) of thine own (head or store, de tuo) without Scripture."
   [Tertul. de carne Christi.] So Saint Justin Martyr before him; "We must
   know by all means," saith he, "that it is not lawful (or possible) to
   learn (anything) of God or of right piety, save only out of the
   Prophets, who teach us by divine inspiration." So Saint Basil after
   Tertullian, "It is a manifest falling way from the Faith, and a fault
   of presumption, either to reject any of those things that are written,
   or to bring in (upon the head of them) any of those things that are not
   written. We omit to cite to the same effect, S. Cyril B. of Jerusalem
   in his 4::Cataches., Saint Jerome against Helvidius, Saint Augustine in
   his 3::book against the letters of Petilian, and in very many other
   places of his works. Also we forebear to descend to later Fathers,
   because we will not weary the reader. The Scriptures then being
   acknowledged to be so full and so perfect, how can we excuse ourselves
   of negligence, if we do not study them, of curiosity, if we be not
   content with them? Men talk much of [an olive bow wrapped about with
   wood, whereupon did hang figs, and bread, honey in a pot, and oil], how
   many sweet and goodly things it had hanging on it; of the Philosopher's
   stone, that it turned copper into gold; of Cornucopia, that it had all
   things necessary for food in it, of Panaces the herb, that it was good
   for diseases, of Catholicon the drug, that it is instead of all purges;
   of Vulcan's armor, that it was an armor of proof against all thrusts,
   and all blows, etc. Well, that which they falsely or vainly attributed
   to these things for bodily god, we may justly and with full measure
   ascribe unto the Scripture, for spiritual. It is not only an armor, but
   also a whole armory of weapons, both offensive and defensive; whereby
   we may save ourselves and put the enemy to flight. It is not an herb,
   but a tree, or rather a whole paradise of trees of life, which bring
   forth fruit every month, and the fruit thereof is for meat, and the
   leaves for medicine. It is not a pot of Manna, or a cruse of oil, which
   were for memory only, or for a meal's meat or two, but as it were a
   shower of heavenly bread sufficient for a whole host, be it never so
   great; and as it were a whole cellar full of oil vessels; whereby all
   our necessities may be provided for, and our debts discharged. In a
   word, it is a Panary of wholesome food, against fenowed traditions; a
   Physician's shop (Saint Basil called it) [S. Basil in Psal. primum.] of
   preservatives against poisoned heresies; a Pandect of profitable laws,
   against rebellious spirits; a treasury of most costly jewels, against
   beggarly rudiments; finally a fountain of most pure water springing up
   unto everlasting life. And what marvel? The original thereof being from
   heaven, not from earth; the author being God, not man; the inditer, the
   holy spirit, not the wit of the Apostles or Prophets; the Penmen such
   as were sanctified from the womb, and endued with a principal portion
   of God's spirit; the matter, verity, piety, purity, uprightness; the
   form, God's word, God's testimony, God's oracles, the word of truth,
   the word of salvation, etc.; the effects, light of understanding,
   stableness of persuasion, repentance from dead works, newness of life,
   holiness, peace, joy in the holy Ghost; lastly, the end and reward of
   the study thereof, fellowship with the Saints, participation of the
   heavenly nature, fruition of an inheritance immortal, undefiled, and
   that never shall fade away: Happy is the man that delighted in the
   Scripture, and thrice happy that meditateth in it day and night.

    TRANSLATION NECESSARY

   But how shall men meditate in that, which they cannot understand? How
   shall they understand that which is kept close in an unknown tongue? as
   it is written, "Except I know the power of the voice, I shall be to him
   that speaketh, a Barbarian, and he that speaketh, shall be a Barbarian
   to me." [1 Cor 14] The Apostle excepteth no tongue; not Hebrew the
   ancientest, not Greek the most copious, not Latin the finest. Nature
   taught a natural man to confess, that all of us in those tongues which
   we do not understand, are plainly deaf; we may turn the deaf ear unto
   them. The Scythian counted the Athenian, whom he did not understand,
   barbarous; [Clem. Alex. 1 Strom.] so the Roman did the Syrian, and the
   Jew (even S. Jerome himself called the Hebrew tongue barbarous, belike
   because it was strange to so many) [S. Jerome. Damaso.] so the Emperor
   of Constantinople [Michael, Theophili fil.] calleth the Latin tongue,
   barbarous, though Pope Nicolas do storm at it: [2::Tom. Concil. ex
   edit. Petri Crab] so the Jews long before Christ called all other
   nations, Lognazim, which is little better than barbarous. Therefore as
   one complaineth, that always in the Senate of Rome, there was one or
   other that called for an interpreter: [Cicero 5::de finibus.] so lest
   the Church be driven to the like exigent, it is necessary to have
   translations in a readiness. Translation it is that openeth the window,
   to let in the light; that breaketh the shell, that we may eat the
   kernel; that putteth aside the curtain, that we may look into the most
   Holy place; that removeth the cover of the well, that we may come by
   the water, even as Jacob rolled away the stone from the mouth of the
   well, by which means the flocks of Laban were watered [Gen 29:10].
   Indeed without translation into the vulgar tongue, the unlearned are
   but like children at Jacob's well (which is deep) [John 4:11] without a
   bucket or something to draw with; or as that person mentioned by
   Isaiah, to whom when a sealed book was delivered, with this motion,
   "Read this, I pray thee," he was fain to make this answer, "I cannot,
   for it is sealed." [Isa 29:11]

    THE TRANSLATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT OUT OF THE HEBREW INTO GREEK

   While God would be known only in Jacob, and have his Name great in
   Israel, and in none other place, while the dew lay on Gideon's fleece
   only, and all the earth besides was dry; then for one and the same
   people, which spake all of them the language of Canaan, that is,
   Hebrew, one and the same original in Hebrew was sufficient. [S. August.
   lib 12 contra Faust c32] But, when the fulness of time drew near, that
   the Sun of righteousness, the Son of God should come into the world,
   whom God ordained to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood,
   not of the Jew only, but also of the Greek, yea, of all them that were
   scattered abroad; then lo, it pleased the Lord to stir up the spirit of
   a Greek Prince (Greek for descent and language) even of Ptolemy
   Philadelph King of Egypt, to procure the translating of the Book of God
   out of Hebrew into Greek. This is the translation of the Seventy
   Interpreters, commonly so called, which prepared the way for our
   Saviour among the Gentiles by written preaching, as Saint John Baptist
   did among the Jews by vocal. For the Grecians being desirous of
   learning, were not wont to suffer books of worth to lie moulding in
   Kings' libraries, but had many of their servants, ready scribes, to
   copy them out, and so they were dispersed and made common. Again, the
   Greek tongue was well known and made familiar to most inhabitants in
   Asia, by reason of the conquest that there the Grecians had made, as
   also by the Colonies, which thither they had sent. For the same causes
   also it was well understood in many places of Europe, yea, and of
   Africa too. Therefore the word of God being set forth in Greek,
   becometh hereby like a candle set upon a candlestick, which giveth
   light to all that are in the house, or like a proclamation sounded
   forth in the market place, which most men presently take knowledge of;
   and therefore that language was fittest to contain the Scriptures, both
   for the first Preachers of the Gospel to appeal unto for witness, and
   for the learners also of those times to make search and trial by. It is
   certain, that that Translation was not so sound and so perfect, but it
   needed in many places correction; and who had been so sufficient for
   this work as the Apostles or Apostolic men? Yet it seemed good to the
   holy Ghost and to them, to take that which they found, (the same being
   for the greatest part true and sufficient) rather than making a new, in
   that new world and green age of the Church, to expose themselves to
   many exceptions and cavillations, as though they made a Translations to
   serve their own turn, and therefore bearing a witness to themselves,
   their witness not to be regarded. This may be supposed to be some
   cause, why the Translation of the Seventy was allowed to pass for
   current. Notwithstanding, though it was commended generally, yet it did
   not fully content the learned, no not of the Jews. For not long after
   Christ, Aquila fell in hand with a new Translation, and after him
   Theodotion, and after him Symmachus; yea, there was a fifth and a sixth
   edition, the Authors whereof were not known. [Epiphan. de mensur. et
   ponderibus.] These with the Seventy made up the Hexapla and were
   worthily and to great purpose compiled together by Origen. Howbeit the
   Edition of the Seventy went away with the credit, and therefore not
   only was placed in the midst by Origen (for the worth and excellency
   thereof above the rest, as Epiphanius gathered) but also was used by
   the Greek fathers for the ground and foundation of their Commentaries.
   Yea, Epiphanius above named doeth attribute so much unto it, that he
   holdeth the Authors thereof not only for Interpreters, but also for
   Prophets in some respect [S. August. 2::de dectrin. Christian c. 15];
   and Justinian the Emperor enjoining the Jews his subjects to use
   especially the Translation of the Seventy, rendreth this reason
   thereof, because they were as it were enlightened with prophetical
   grace. Yet for all that, as the Egyptians are said of the Prophet to be
   men and not God, and their horses flesh and not spirit [Isa 31:3]; so
   it is evident, (and Saint Jerome affirmeth as much) [S. Jerome. de
   optimo genere interpret.] that the Seventy were Interpreters, they were
   not Prophets; they did many things well, as learned men; but yet as men
   they stumbled and fell, one while through oversight, another while
   through ignorance, yea, sometimes they may be noted to add to the
   Original, and sometimes to take from it; which made the Apostles to
   leave them many times, when they left the Hebrew, and to deliver the
   sense thereof according to the truth of the word, as the spirit gave
   them utterance. This may suffice touching the Greek Translations of the
   Old Testament.

    TRANSLATION OUT OF HEBREW AND GREEK INTO LATIN

   There were also within a few hundred years after CHRIST, translations
   many into the Latin tongue: for this tongue also was very fit to convey
   the Law and the Gospel by, because in those times very many Countries
   of the West, yea of the South, East and North, spake or understood
   Latin, being made Provinces to the Romans. But now the Latin
   Translations were too many to be all good, for they were infinite
   (Latini Interprets nullo modo numerari possunt, saith S. Augustine.)
   [S. Augustin. de doctr. Christ. lib 2 cap II]. Again they were not out
   of the Hebrew fountain (we speak of the Latin Translations of the Old
   Testament) but out of the Greek stream, therefore the Greek being not
   altogether clear, the Latin derived from it must needs be muddy. This
   moved S. Jerome a most learned father, and the best linguist without
   controversy, of his age, or of any that went before him, to undertake
   the translating of the Old Testament, out of the very fountain with
   that evidence of great learning, judgment, industry, and faithfulness,
   that he had forever bound the Church unto him, in a debt of special
   remembrance and thankfulness.

    THE TRANSLATING OF THE SCRIPTURE INTO THE VULGAR TONGUES

   Now through the Church were thus furnished with Greek and Latin
   Translations, even before the faith of CHRIST was generally embraced in
   the Empire; (for the learned know that even in S. Jerome's time, the
   Consul of Rome and his wife were both Ethnics, and about the same time
   the greatest part of the Senate also) [S. Jerome. Marcell.Zosim] yet
   for all that the godly-learned were not content to have the Scriptures
   in the Language which they themselves understood, Greek and Latin, (as
   the good Lepers were not content to fare well themselves, but
   acquainted their neighbors with the store that God had sent, that they
   also might provide for themselves) [2 Kings 7:9] but also for the
   behoof and edifying of the unlearned which hungered and thirsted after
   righteousness, and had souls to be saved as well as they, they provided
   Translations into the vulgar for their Countrymen, insomuch that most
   nations under heaven did shortly after their conversion, hear CHRIST
   speaking unto them in their mother tongue, not by the voice of their
   Minister only, but also by the written word translated. If any doubt
   hereof, he may be satisfied by examples enough, if enough will serve
   the turn. First S. Jerome saith, Multarum gentium linguis Scriptura
   ante translata, docet falsa esse quae addita sunt, etc. i.e. "The
   Scripture being translated before in the languages of many Nations,
   doth show that those things that were added (by Lucian and Hesychius)
   are false." [S. Jerome. praef. in 4::Evangel.] So S. Jerome in that
   place. The same Jerome elsewhere affirmeth that he, the time was, had
   set forth the translation of the Seventy suae linguae hominibus, i.e.,
   for his countrymen of Dalmatia [S. Jerome. Sophronio.] Which words not
   only Erasmus doth understand to purport, that S. Jerome translated the
   Scripture into the Dalmatian tongue, but also Sixtus Senensis [Six.
   Sen. lib 4], and Alphonsus a` Castro [Alphon. lb 1 ca 23] (that we
   speak of no more) men not to be excepted against by them of Rome, do
   ingenuously confess as much. So, S. Chrysostom that lived in S.
   Jerome's time, giveth evidence with him: "The doctrine of S. John
   [saith he] did not in such sort [as the Philosophers' did] vanish away:
   but the Syrians, Egyptians, Indians, Persians, Ethiopians, and infinite
   other nations being barbarous people translated it into their [mother]
   tongue, and have learned to be [true] Philosophers," he meaneth
   Christians. [S. Chrysost. in Johan. cap.I. hom.I.] To this may be added
   Theodoret, as next unto him, both for antiquity, and for learning. His
   words be these, "Every Country that is under the Sun, is full of these
   words (of the Apostles and Prophets) and the Hebrew tongue [he meaneth
   the Scriptures in the Hebrew tongue] is turned not only into the
   Language of the Grecians, but also of the Romans, and Egyptians, and
   Persians, and Indians, and Armenians, and Scythians, and Sauromatians,
   and briefly into all the Languages that any Nation useth. [Theodor. 5.
   Therapeut.] So he. In like manner, Ulfilas is reported by Paulus
   Diaconus and Isidor (and before them by Sozomen) to have translated the
   Scriptures into the Gothic tongue: [P. Diacon. li. 12.] John Bishop of
   Sevil by Vasseus, to have turned them into Arabic, about the year of
   our Lord 717; [Vaseus in Chron. Hispan.] Bede by Cistertiensis, to have
   turned a great part of them into Saxon: Efnard by Trithemius, to have
   abridged the French Psalter, as Beded had done the Hebrew, about the
   year 800: King Alfred by the said Cistertiensis, to have turned the
   Psalter into Saxon: [Polydor. Virg. 5 histor.] Methodius by Aventinus
   (printed at Ingolstadt) to have turned the Scriptures into Slavonian:
   [Aventin. lib. 4.] Valdo, Bishop of Frising by Beatus Rhenanus, to have
   caused about that time, the Gospels to be translated into Dutch rhythm,
   yet extant in the Library of Corbinian: [Circa annum 900. B. Rhenan.
   rerum German. lib 2.] Valdus, by divers to have turned them himself
   into French, about the year 1160: Charles the Fifth of that name,
   surnamed the Wise, to have caused them to be turned into French, about
   200 years after Valdus his time, of which translation there be many
   copies yet extant, as witnesseth Beroaldus. Much about that time, even
   in our King Richard the second's days, John Trevisa translated them
   into English, and many English Bibles in written hand are yet to be
   seen with divers, translated as it is very probable, in that age. So
   the Syrian translation of the New Testament is in most learned men's
   Libraries, of Widminstadius his setting forth, and the Psalter in
   Arabic is with many, of Augustinus Nebiensis' setting forth. So Postel
   affirmeth, that in his travel he saw the Gospels in the Ethiopian
   tongue; And Ambrose Thesius allegeth the Pslater of the Indians, which
   he testifieth to have been set forth by Potken in Syrian characters. So
   that, to have the Scriptures in the mother tongue is not a quaint
   conceit lately taken up, either by the Lord Cromwell in England,
   [Thuan.] or by the Lord Radevile in Polony, or by the Lord Ungnadius in
   the Emperor's dominion, but hath been thought upon, and put in practice
   of old, even from the first times of the conversion of any Nation; no
   doubt, because it was esteemed most profitable, to cause faith to grow
   in men's hearts the sooner, and to make them to be able to say with the
   words of the Psalms, "As we have heard, so we have seen." [Ps 48:8]

    THE UNWILLINGNESS OF OUR CHIEF ADVERSARIES, THAT THE SCRIPTURES SHOULD BE
    DIVULGED IN THE MOTHER TONGUE, ETC.

   Now the Church of Rome would seem at the length to bear a motherly
   affection towards her children, and to allow them the Scriptures in
   their mother tongue: but indeed it is a gift, not deserving to be
   called a gift, an unprofitable gift: [Sophecles] they must first get a
   licence in writing before they may use them, and to get that, they must
   approve themselves to their Confessor, that is, to be such as are, if
   not frozen in the dregs, yet soured with the leaven of their
   superstition. Howbeit, it seemed too much to Clement the Eighth that
   there should be any Licence granted to have them in the vulgar tongue,
   and therefore he overruleth and frustrateth the grant of Pius the
   Fourth. [See the observation (set forth by Clemen. His authority) upon
   the 4. rule of Pius the 4. his making in the index, lib. prohib. pag.
   15. ver. 5.] So much are they afraid of the light of the Scripture,
   (Lucifugae Scripturarum, as Tertulian speaketh) that they will not
   trust the people with it, no not as it is set forth by their own sworn
   men, no not with the Licence of their own Bishops and Inquisitors. Yea,
   so unwilling they are to communicate the Scriptures to the people's
   understanding in any sort, that they are not ashamed to confess, that
   we forced them to translate it into English against their wills. This
   seemeth to argue a bad cause, or a bad conscience, or both. Sure we
   are, that it is not he that hath good gold, that is afraid to bring it
   to the touchstone, but he that hath the counterfeit; [Tertul. de resur.
   carnis.] neither is it the true man that shunneth the light, but the
   malefactor, lest his deeds should be reproved [John 3:20]: neither is
   it the plaindealing Merchant that is unwilling to have the weights, or
   the meteyard brought in place, but he that useth deceit. But we will
   let them alone for this fault, and return to translation.

    THE SPEECHES AND REASONS, BOTH OF OUR BRETHREN, AND OF OUR ADVERSARIES
    AGAINST THIS WORK

   Many men's mouths have been open a good while (and yet are not stopped)
   with speeches about the Translation so long in hand, or rather perusals
   of Translations made before: and ask what may be the reason, what the
   necessity of the employment: Hath the Church been deceived, say they,
   all this while? Hath her sweet bread been mingled with leaven, here
   silver with dross, her wine with water, her milk with lime? (Lacte
   gypsum male miscetur, saith S. Ireney,) [S. Iren. 3. lib. cap. 19.] We
   hoped that we had been in the right way, that we had the Oracles of God
   delivered unto us, and that though all the world had cause to be
   offended and to complain, yet that we had none. Hath the nurse holden
   out the breast, and nothing but wind in it? Hath the bread been
   delivered by the fathers of the Church, and the same proved to be
   lapidosus, as Seneca speaketh? What is it to handle the word of God
   deceitfully, if this be not? Thus certain brethren. Also the
   adversaries of Judah and Jerusalem, like Sanballat in Nehemiah, mock,
   as we hear, both the work and the workmen, saying; "What do these weak
   Jews, etc. will they make the stones whole again out of the heaps of
   dust which are burnt? although they build, yet if a fox go up, he shall
   even break down their stony wall." [Neh 4:3] Was their Translation good
   before? Why do they now mend it? Was it not good? Why then was it
   obtruded to the people? Yea, why did the Catholics (meaning Popish
   Romanists) always go in jeopardy, for refusing to go to hear it? Nay,
   if it must be translated into English, Catholics are fittest to do it.
   They have learning, and they know when a thing is well, they can manum
   de tabula. We will answer them both briefly: and the former, being
   brethren, thus, with S. Jerome, "Damnamus veteres? Mineme, sed post
   priorum studia in domo Domini quod possums laboramus." [S. Jerome.
   Apolog. advers. Ruffin.] That is, "Do we condemn the ancient? In no
   case: but after the endeavors of them that were before us, we take the
   best pains we can in the house of God." As if he said, Being provoked
   by the example of the learned men that lived before my time, I have
   thought it my duty, to assay whether my talent in the knowledge of the
   tongues, may be profitable in any measure to God's Church, lest I
   should seem to laboured in them in vain, and lest I should be thought
   to glory in men, (although ancient,) above that which was in them. Thus
   S. Jerome may be thought to speak.

    A SATISFACTION TO OUR BRETHREN

   And to the same effect say we, that we are so far off from condemning
   any of their labors that travailed before us in this kind, either in
   this land or beyond sea, either in King Henry's time, or King Edward's
   (if there were any translation, or correction of a translation in his
   time) or Queen Elizabeth's of ever renowned memory, that we acknowledge
   them to have been raised up of God, for the building and furnishing of
   his Church, and that they deserve to be had of us and of posterity in
   everlasting remembrance. The judgment of Aristotle is worthy and well
   known: "If Timotheus had not been, we had not had much sweet music; but
   if Phrynis [Timotheus his master] had not been, we had not had
   Timotheus." Therefore blessed be they, and most honoured be their name,
   that break the ice, and giveth onset upon that which helpeth forward to
   the saving of souls. Now what can be more available thereto, than to
   deliver God's book unto God's people in a tongue which they understand?
   Since of a hidden treasure, and of a fountain that is sealed, there is
   no profit, as Ptolemy Philadelph wrote to the Rabbins or masters of the
   Jews, as witnesseth Epiphanius: [S. Epiphan. loco ante citato.] and as
   S. Augustine saith; "A man had rather be with his dog than with a
   stranger (whose tongue is strange unto him)." [S. Augustin. lib. 19. de
   civil. Dei. c. 7.] Yet for all that, as nothing is begun and perfected
   at the same time, and the later thoughts are thought to be the wiser:
   so, if we building upon their foundation that went before us, and being
   holpen by their labours, do endeavor to make that better which they
   left so good; no man, we are sure, hath cause to mislike us; they, we
   persuade ourselves, if they were alive, would thank us. The vintage of
   Abienzer, that strake the stroke: yet the gleaning of grapes of Ephraim
   was not to be despised. See Judges 8:2. Joash the king of Israel did
   not satisfy himself, till he had smitten the ground three times; and
   yet he offended the Prophet, for giving over then. [2 Kings 13:18-19]
   Aquila, of whom we spake before, translated the Bible as carefully, and
   as skilfully as he could; and yet he thought good to go over it again,
   and then it got the credit with the Jews, to be called accurately done,
   as Saint Jerome witnesseth. [S. Jerome. in Ezech. cap. 3.] How many
   books of profane learning have been gone over again and again, by the
   same translators, by others? Of one and the same book of Aristotle's
   Ethics, there are extant not so few as six or seven several
   translations. Now if this cost may be bestowed upon the gourd, which
   affordeth us a little shade, and which today flourisheth, but tomorrow
   is cut down; what may we bestow, nay what ought we not to bestow upon
   the Vine, the fruit whereof maketh glad the conscience of man, and the
   stem whereof abideth forever? And this is the word of God, which we
   translate. "What is the chaff to the wheat, saith the Lord?" [Jer
   23:28] Tanti vitreum, quanti verum margaritum (saith Tertullian,)
   [Tertul. ad Martyr.] if a toy of glass be of that reckoning with us,
   how ought we to value the true pearl? [Jerome. ad Salvin.] Therefore
   let no man's eye be evil, because his Majesty's is good; neither let
   any be grieved, that we have a Prince that seeketh the increase of the
   spiritual wealth of Israel (let Sanballats and Tobiahs do so, which
   therefore do bear their just reproof) but let us rather bless God from
   the ground of our heart, for working this religious care in him, to
   have the translations of the Bible maturely considered of and examined.
   For by this means it cometh to pass, that whatsoever is sound already
   (and all is sound for substance, in one or other of our editions, and
   the worst of ours far better than their authentic vulgar) the same will
   shine as gold more brightly, being rubbed and polished; also, if
   anything be halting, or superfluous, or not so agreeable to the
   original, the same may be corrected, and the truth set in place. And
   what can the King command to be done, that will bring him more true
   honour than this? and wherein could they that have been set a work,
   approve their duty to the King, yea their obedience to God, and love to
   his Saints more, than by yielding their service, and all that is within
   them, for the furnishing of the work? But besides all this, they were
   the principal motives of it, and therefore ought least to quarrel it:
   for the very Historical truth is, that upon the importunate petitions
   of the Puritans, at his Majesty's coming to this Crown, the Conference
   at Hampton Court having been appointed for hearing their complaints:
   when by force of reason they were put from other grounds, they had
   recourse at the last, to this shift, that they could not with good
   conscience subscribe to the Communion book, since it maintained the
   Bible as it was there translated, which was as they said, a most
   corrupted translation. And although this was judged to be but a very
   poor and empty shift; yet even hereupon did his Majesty begin to
   bethink himself of the good that might ensue by a new translation, and
   presently after gave order for this Translation which is now presented
   unto thee. Thus much to satisfy our scrupulous Brethren.

    AN ANSWER TO THE IMPUTATIONS OF OUR ADVERSARIES

   Now to the latter we answer; that we do not deny, nay we affirm and
   avow, that the very meanest translation of the Bible in English, set
   forth by men of our profession, (for we have seen none of theirs of the
   whole Bible as yet) containeth the word of God, nay, is the word of
   God. As the King's speech, which he uttereth in Parliament, being
   translated into French, Dutch, Italian, and Latin, is still the King's
   speech, though it be not interpreted by every Translator with the like
   grace, nor peradventure so fitly for phrase, nor so expressly for
   sense, everywhere. For it is confessed, that things are to take their
   denomination of the greater part; and a natural man could say, Verum
   ubi multa nitent in carmine, non ego paucis offendor maculis, etc.
   [Horace.] A man may be counted a virtuous man, though he have made many
   slips in his life, (else, there were none virtuous, for in many things
   we offend all) [James 3:2] also a comely man and lovely, though he have
   some warts upon his hand, yea, not only freckles upon his face, but
   also scars. No cause therefore why the word translated should be denied
   to be the word, or forbidden to be current, notwithstanding that some
   imperfections and blemishes may be noted in the setting forth of it.
   For whatever was perfect under the Sun, where Apostles or Apostolic
   men, that is, men endued with an extraordinary measure of God's spirit,
   and privileged with the privilege of infallibility, had not their hand?
   The Romanists therefore in refusing to hear, and daring to burn the
   Word translated, did no less than despite the spirit of grace, from
   whom originally it proceeded, and whose sense and meaning, as well as
   man's weakness would enable, it did express. Judge by an example or
   two. Plutarch writeth, that after that Rome had been burnt by the
   Gauls, they fell soon to build it again: but doing it in haste, they
   did not cast the streets, nor proportion the houses in such comely
   fashion, as had been most slightly and convenient; [Plutarch in
   Camillo.] was Catiline therefore an honest man, or a good patriot, that
   sought to bring it to a combustion? or Nero a good Prince, that did
   indeed set it on fire? So, by the story of Ezra, and the prophecy of
   Haggai it may be gathered, that the Temple built by Zerubbabel after
   the return from Babylon, was by no means to be compared to the former
   built by Solomon (for they that remembered the former, wept when they
   considered the latter) [Ezra 3:12] notwithstanding, might this latter
   either have been abhorred and forsaken by the Jews, or profaned by the
   Greeks? The like we are to think of Translations. The translation of
   the Seventy dissenteth from the Original in many places, neither doth
   it come near it, for perspicuity, gravity, majesty; yet which of the
   Apostles did condemn it? Condemn it? Nay, they used it, (as it is
   apparent, and as Saint Jerome and most learned men do confess) which
   they would not have done, nor by their example of using it, so grace
   and commend it to the Church, if it had been unworthy of the
   appellation and name of the word of God. And whereas they urge for
   their second defence of their vilifying and abusing of the English
   Bibles, or some pieces thereof, which they meet with, for that heretics
   (forsooth) were the Authors of the translations, (heretics they call us
   by the same right that they call themselves Catholics, both being
   wrong) we marvel what divinity taught them so. We are sure Tertullian
   was of another mind: Ex personis probamus fidem, an ex fide personas?
   [Tertul. de praescript. contra haereses.] Do we try men's faith by
   their persons? we should try their persons by their faith. Also S.
   Augustine was of another mind: for he lighting upon certain rules made
   by Tychonius a Donatist, for the better understanding of the word, was
   not ashamed to make use of them, yea, to insert them into his own book,
   with giving commendation to them so far forth as they were worthy to be
   commended, as is to be seen in S. Augustine's third book De doctrina
   Christiana. [S. August. 3. de doct. Christ. cap. 30.] To be short,
   Origen, and the whole Church of God for certain hundred years, were of
   another mind: for they were so far from treading under foot, (much more
   from burning) the Translation of Aquila a Proselyte, that is, one that
   had turned Jew; of Symmachus, and Theodotion, both Ebionites, that is,
   most vile heretics, that they joined together with the Hebrew Original,
   and the Translation of the Seventy (as hath been before signified out
   of Epiphanius) and set them forth openly to be considered of and
   perused by all. But we weary the unlearned, who need not know so much,
   and trouble the learned, who know it already.

   Yet before we end, we must answer a third cavil and objection of theirs
   against us, for altering and amending our Translations so oft; wherein
   truly they deal hardly, and strangely with us. For to whomever was it
   imputed for a fault (by such as were wise) to go over that which he had
   done, and to amend it where he saw cause? Saint Augustine was not
   afraid to exhort S. Jerome to a Palinodia or recantation; [S. Aug.
   Epist. 9.] and doth even glory that he seeth his infirmities. [S. Aug.
   Epist. 8.] If we be sons of the Truth, we must consider what it
   speaketh, and trample upon our own credit, yea, and upon other men's
   too, if either be any way an hindrance to it. This to the cause: then
   to the persons we say, that of all men they ought to be most silent in
   this case. For what varieties have they, and what alterations have they
   made, not only of their Service books, Portesses and Breviaries, but
   also of their Latin Translation? The Service book supposed to be made
   by S. Ambrose (Officium Ambrosianum) was a great while in special use
   and request; but Pope Hadrian calling a Council with the aid of Charles
   the Emperor, abolished it, yea, burnt it, and commanded the Service
   book of Saint Gregory universally to be used. [Durand. lib. 5. cap. 2.]
   Well, Officium Gregorianum gets by this means to be in credit, but doth
   it continue without change or altering? No, the very Roman Service was
   of two fashions, the New fashion, and the Old, (the one used in one
   Church, the other in another) as is to be seen in Pamelius a Romanist,
   his Preface, before Micrologus. the same Pamelius reporteth out
   Radulphus de Rivo, that about the year of our Lord, 1277, Pope Nicolas
   the Third removed out of the Churches of Rome, the more ancient books
   (of Service) and brought into use the Missals of the Friers Minorites,
   and commanded them to be observed there; insomuch that about an hundred
   years after, when the above name Radulphus happened to be at Rome, he
   found all the books to be new, (of the new stamp). Neither were there
   this chopping and changing in the more ancient times only, but also of
   late: Pius Quintus himself confesseth, that every Bishopric almost had
   a peculiar kind of service, most unlike to that which others had: which
   moved him to abolish all other Breviaries, though never so ancient, and
   privileged and published by Bishops in their Dioceses, and to establish
   and ratify that only which was of his own setting forth, in the year
   1568. Now when the father of their Church, who gladly would heal the
   sore of the daughter of his people softly and slightly, and make the
   best of it, findeth so great fault with them for their odds and
   jarring; we hope the children have no great cause to vaunt of their
   uniformity. But the difference that appeareth between our Translations,
   and our often correcting of them, is the thing that we are specially
   charged with; let us see therefore whether they themselves be without
   fault this way, (if it be to be counted a fault, to correct) and
   whether they be fit men to throw stones at us: O tandem maior parcas
   insane minori: they that are less sound themselves, out not to object
   infirmities to others. [Horat.] If we should tell them that Valla,
   Stapulensis, Erasmus, and Vives found fault with their vulgar
   Translation, and consequently wished the same to be mended, or a new
   one to be made, they would answer peradventure, that we produced their
   enemies for witnesses against them; albeit, they were in no other sort
   enemies, than as S. Paul was to the Galatians, for telling them the
   truth [Gal 4:16]: and it were to be wished, that they had dared to tell
   it them plainlier and oftener. But what will they say to this, that
   Pope Leo the Tenth allowed Erasmus' Translation of the New Testament,
   so much different from the vulgar, by his Apostolic Letter and Bull;
   that the same Leo exhorted Pagnine to translate the whole Bible, and
   bare whatsoever charges was necessary for the work? [Sixtus Senens.]
   Surely, as the Apostle reasoneth to the Hebrews, that if the former Law
   and Testament had been sufficient, there had been no need of the
   latter: [Heb 7:11 and 8:7] so we may say, that if the old vulgar had
   been at all points allowable, to small purpose had labour and charges
   been undergone, about framing of a new. If they say, it was one Pope's
   private opinion, and that he consulted only himself; then we are able
   to go further with them, and to aver, that more of their chief men of
   all sorts, even their own Trent champions Paiva and Vega, and their own
   Inquisitors, Hieronymus ab Oleastro, and their own Bishop Isidorus
   Clarius, and their own Cardinal Thomas a Vio Caietan, do either make
   new Translations themselves, or follow new ones of other men's making,
   or note the vulgar Interpreter for halting; none of them fear to
   dissent from him, nor yet to except against him. And call they this an
   uniform tenor of text and judgment about the text, so many of their
   Worthies disclaiming the now received conceit? Nay, we will yet come
   nearer the quick: doth not their Paris edition differ from the Lovaine,
   and Hentenius his from them both, and yet all of them allowed by
   authority? Nay, doth not Sixtus Quintus confess, that certain Catholics
   (he meaneth certain of his own side) were in such an humor of
   translating the Scriptures into Latin, that Satan taking occasion by
   them, though they thought of no such matter, did strive what he could,
   out of so uncertain and manifold a variety of Translations, so to
   mingle all things, that nothing might seem to be left certain and firm
   in them, etc.? [Sixtus 5. praefat. fixa Bibliis.] Nay, further, did not
   the same Sixtus ordain by an inviolable decree, and that with the
   counsel and consent of his Cardinals, that the Latin edition of the old
   and new Testament, which the Council of Trent would have to be
   authentic, is the same without controversy which he then set forth,
   being diligently corrected and printed in the Printinghouse of Vatican?
   Thus Sixtus in his Preface before his Bible. And yet Clement the Eighth
   his immediate successor, published another edition of the Bible,
   containing in it infinite differences from that of Sixtus, (and many of
   them weighty and material) and yet this must be authentic by all means.
   What is to have the faith of our glorious Lord JESUS CHRIST with Yea or
   Nay, if this be not? Again, what is sweet harmony and consent, if this
   be? Therefore, as Demaratus of Corinth advised a great King, before he
   talked of the dissensions of the Grecians, to compose his domestic
   broils (for at that time his Queen and his son and heir were at deadly
   feud with him) so all the while that our adversaries do make so many
   and so various editions themselves, and do jar so much about the worth
   and authority of them, they can with no show of equity challenge us for
   changing and correcting.

    THE PURPOSE OF THE TRANSLATORS, WITH THEIR NUMBER, FURNITURE, CARE, ETC.

   But it is high time to leave them, and to show in brief what we
   proposed to ourselves, and what course we held in this our perusal and
   survey of the Bible. Truly (good Christian Reader) we never thought
   from the beginning, that we should need to make a new Translation, nor
   yet to make of a bad one a good one, (for then the imputation of Sixtus
   had been true in some sort, that our people had been fed with gall of
   Dragons instead of wine, with whey instead of milk:) but to make a good
   one better, or out of many good ones, one principal good one, not
   justly to be excepted against; that hath been our endeavor, that our
   mark. To that purpose there were many chosen, that were greater in
   other men's eyes than in their own, and that sought the truth rather
   than their own praise. Again, they came or were thought to come to the
   work, not exercendi causa (as one saith) but exercitati, that is,
   learned, not to learn: For the chief overseer and [NOTE: Greek letters
   omitted] under his Majesty, to whom not only we, but also our whole
   Church was much bound, knew by his wisdom, which thing also Nazianzen
   taught so long ago, that it is a preposterous order to teach first and
   to learn after, yea that [NOTE: Greek letters omitted] to learn and
   practice together, is neither commendable for the workman, nor safe for
   the work. [Idem in Apologet.] Therefore such were thought upon, as
   could say modestly with Saint Jerome, Et Hebreaeum Sermonem ex parte
   didicimus, et in Latino pene ab ipsis incunabulis etc. detriti sumus.
   "Both we have learned the Hebrew tongue in part, and in the Latin we
   have been exercised almost from our very cradle." S. Jerome maketh no
   mention of the Greek tongue, wherein yet he did excel, because he
   translated not the old Testament out of Greek, but out of Hebrew. And
   in what sort did these assemble? In the trust of their own knowledge,
   or of their sharpness of wit, or deepness of judgment, as it were in an
   arm of flesh? At no hand. They trusted in him that hath the key of
   David, opening and no man shutting; they prayed to the Lord the Father
   of our Lord, to the effect that S. Augustine did; "O let thy Scriptures
   be my pure delight, let me not be deceived in them, neither let me
   deceive by them." [S. Aug. lib. II. Confess. cap. 2.] In this
   confidence, and with this devotion did they assemble together; not too
   many, lest one should trouble another; and yet many, lest many things
   haply might escape them. If you ask what they had before them, truly it
   was the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, the Greek of the New. These
   are the two golden pipes, or rather conduits, where-through the olive
   branches empty themselves into the gold. Saint Augustine calleth them
   precedent, or original tongues; [S. August. 3. de doctr. c. 3. etc.]
   Saint Jerome, fountains. [S. Jerome. ad Suniam et Fretel.] The same
   Saint Jerome affirmeth, [S. Jerome. ad Lucinium, Dist. 9 ut veterum.]
   and Gratian hath not spared to put it into his Decree, That "as the
   credit of the old Books" (he meaneth of the Old Testament) "is to be
   tried by the Hebrew Volumes, so of the New by the Greek tongue," he
   meaneth by the original Greek. If truth be tried by these tongues, then
   whence should a Translation be made, but out of them? These tongues
   therefore, the Scriptures we say in those tongues, we set before us to
   translate, being the tongues wherein God was pleased to speak to his
   Church by the Prophets and Apostles. Neither did we run over the work
   with that posting haste that the Septuagint did, if that be true which
   is reported of them, that they finished it in 72 days; [Joseph. Antiq.
   lib. 12.] neither were we barred or hindered from going over it again,
   having once done it, like S. Jerome, if that be true which himself
   reporteth, that he could no sooner write anything, but presently it was
   caught from him, and published, and he could not have leave to mend it:
   [S. Jerome. ad Pammac. pro libr. advers. Iovinian.] neither, to be
   short, were we the first that fell in hand with translating the
   Scripture into English, and consequently destitute of former helps, as
   it is written of Origen, that he was the first in a manner, that put
   his hand to write Commentaries upon the Scriptures, [Sophoc. in Elect.]
   and therefore no marvel, if he overshot himself many times. None of
   these things: the work hath not been huddled up in 72 days, but hath
   cost the workmen, as light as it seemeth, the pains of twice seven
   times seventy two days and more: matters of such weight and consequence
   are to be speeded with maturity: for in a business of movement a man
   feareth not the blame of convenient slackness. [S. Chrysost. in II.
   Thess. cap. 2.] Neither did we think much to consult the Translators or
   Commentators, Chaldee, Hebrew, Syrian, Greek or Latin, no nor the
   Spanish, French, Italian, or Dutch; neither did we disdain to revise
   that which we had done, and to bring back to the anvil that which we
   had hammered: but having and using as great helps as were needful, and
   fearing no reproach for slowness, nor coveting praise for expedition,
   we have at length, through the good hand of the Lord upon us, brought
   the work to that pass that you see.

    REASONS MOVING US TO SET DIVERSITY OF SENSES IN THE MARGIN, WHERE THERE IS
    GREAT PROBABILITY FOR EACH

   Some peradventure would have no variety of senses to be set in the
   margin, lest the authority of the Scriptures for deciding of
   controversies by that show of uncertainty, should somewhat be shaken.
   But we hold their judgment not to be sound in this point. For though,
   "whatsoever things are necessary are manifest," as S. Chrysostom saith,
   [S. Chrysost. in II. Thess. cap. 2.] and as S. Augustine, "In those
   things that are plainly set down in the Scriptures, all such matters
   are found that concern Faith, Hope, and Charity. [S. Aug. 2. de doctr.
   Christ. cap. 9.] Yet for all that it cannot be dissembled, that partly
   to exercise and whet our wits, partly to wean the curious from the
   loathing of them for their everywhere plainness, partly also to stir up
   our devotion to crave the assistance of God's spirit by prayer, and
   lastly, that we might be forward to seek aid of our brethren by
   conference, and never scorn those that be not in all respects so
   complete as they should be, being to seek in many things ourselves, it
   hath pleased God in his divine providence, here and there to scatter
   words and sentences of that difficulty and doubtfulness, not in
   doctrinal points that concern salvation, (for in such it hath been
   vouched that the Scriptures are plain) but in matters of less moment,
   that fearfulness would better beseem us than confidence, and if we will
   resolve upon modesty with S. Augustine, (though not in this same case
   altogether, yet upon the same ground) Melius est debitare de occultis,
   quam litigare de incertis, [S. Aug li. S. de Genes. ad liter. cap. 5.]
   "it is better to make doubt of those things which are secret, than to
   strive about those things that are uncertain." There be many words in
   the Scriptures, which be never found there but once, (having neither
   brother or neighbor, as the Hebrews speak) so that we cannot be holpen
   by conference of places. Again, there be many rare names of certain
   birds, beasts and precious stones, etc. concerning the Hebrews
   themselves are so divided among themselves for judgment, that they may
   seem to have defined this or that, rather because they would say
   something, than because they were sure of that which they said, as S.
   Jerome somewhere saith of the Septuagint. Now in such a case, doth not
   a margin do well to admonish the Reader to seek further, and not to
   conclude or dogmatize upon this or that peremptorily? For as it is a
   fault of incredulity, to doubt of those things that are evident: so to
   determine of such things as the Spirit of God hath left (even in the
   judgment of the judicious) questionable, can be no less than
   presumption. Therefore as S. Augustine saith, that variety of
   Translations is profitable for the finding out of the sense of the
   Scriptures: [S. Aug. 2. De doctr. Christian. cap. 14.] so diversity of
   signification and sense in the margin, where the text is no so clear,
   must needs do good, yea, is necessary, as we are persuaded. We know
   that Sixtus Quintus expressly forbiddeth, that any variety of readings
   of their vulgar edition, should be put in the margin, [Sixtus 5. praef.
   Bibliae.] (which though it be not altogether the same thing to that we
   have in hand, yet it looketh that way) but we think he hath not all of
   his own side his favorers, for this conceit. They that are wise, had
   rather have their judgments at liberty in differences of readings, than
   to be captivated to one, when it may be the other. If they were sure
   that their high Priest had all laws shut up in his breast, as Paul the
   Second bragged, [Plat. in Paulo secundo.] and that he were as free from
   error by special privilege, as the Dictators of Rome were made by law
   inviolable, it were another matter; then his word were an Oracle, his
   opinion a decision. But the eyes of the world are now open, God be
   thanked, and have been a great while, they find that he is subject to
   the same affections and infirmities that others be, that his skin is
   penetrable, and therefore so much as he proveth, not as much as he
   claimeth, they grant and embrace.

    REASONS INDUCING US NOT TO STAND CURIOUSLY UPON AN IDENTITY OF PHRASING

   Another things we think good to admonish thee of (gentle Reader) that
   we have not tied ourselves to an uniformity of phrasing, or to an
   identity of words, as some peradventure would wish that we had done,
   because they observe, that some learned men somewhere, have been as
   exact as they could that way. Truly, that we might not vary from the
   sense of that which we had translated before, if the word signified
   that same in both places (for there be some words that be not the same
   sense everywhere) we were especially careful, and made a conscience,
   according to our duty. But, that we should express the same notion in
   the same particular word; as for example, if we translate the Hebrew or
   Greek word once by PURPOSE, never to call it INTENT; if one where
   JOURNEYING, never TRAVELING; if one where THINK, never SUPPOSE; if one
   where PAIN, never ACHE; if one where JOY, never GLADNESS, etc. Thus to
   mince the matter, we thought to savour more of curiosity than wisdom,
   and that rather it would breed scorn in the Atheist, than bring profit
   to the godly Reader. For is the kingdom of God to become words or
   syllables? why should we be in bondage to them if we may be free, use
   one precisely when we may use another no less fit, as commodiously? A
   godly Father in the Primitive time showed himself greatly moved, that
   one of newfangledness called [NOTE: Greek omitted but was a dispute
   over the word for "a bed"] [Niceph. Calist. lib.8. cap.42.] though the
   difference be little or none; and another reporteth that he was much
   abused for turning "Cucurbita" (to which reading the people had been
   used) into "Hedera". [S. Jerome in 4. Ionae. See S. Aug: epist. 10.]
   Now if this happens in better times, and upon so small occasions, we
   might justly fear hard censure, if generally we should make verbal and
   unnecessary changings. We might also be charged (by scoffers) with some
   unequal dealing towards a great number of good English words. For as it
   is written of a certain great Philosopher, that he should say , that
   those logs were happy that were made images to be worshipped; for their
   fellows, as good as they, lay for blocks behind the fire: so if we
   should say, as it were, unto certain words, Stand up higher, have a
   place in the Bible always, and to others of like quality, Get ye hence,
   be banished forever, we might be taxed peradventure with S. James his
   words, namely, "To be partial in ourselves and judges of evil
   thoughts." Add hereunto, that niceness in words was always counted the
   next step to trifling, and so was to be curious about names too: also
   that we cannot follow a better pattern for elocution than God himself;
   therefore he using divers words, in his holy writ, and indifferently
   for one thing in nature: [see Euseb. li. 12. ex Platon.] we, if we will
   not be superstitious, may use the same liberty in our English versions
   out of Hebrew and Greek, for that copy or store that he hath given us.
   Lastly, we have on the one side avoided the scrupulosity of the
   Puritans, who leave the old Ecclesiastical words, and betake them to
   other, as when they put WASHING for BAPTISM, and CONGREGATION instead
   of CHURCH: as also on the other side we have shunned the obscurity of
   the Papists, in their AZIMES, TUNIKE, RATIONAL, HOLOCAUSTS, PRAEPUCE,
   PASCHE, and a number of such like, whereof their late Translation is
   full, and that of purpose to darken the sense, that since they must
   needs translate the Bible, yet by the language thereof, it may be kept
   from being understood. But we desire that the Scripture may speak like
   itself, as in the language of Canaan, that it may be understood even of
   the very vulgar.

   Many other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if we
   had not exceeded the measure of a Preface already. It remaineth, that
   we commend thee to God, and to the Spirit of his grace, which is able
   to build further than we can ask or think. He removeth the scales from
   our eyes, the vail from our hearts, opening our wits that we may
   understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our
   affections, that we may love it to the end. Ye are brought unto
   fountains of living water which ye digged not; do not cast earth into
   them with the Philistines, neither prefer broken pits before them with
   the wicked Jews. [Gen 26:15. Jer 2:13.] Others have laboured, and you
   may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things in vain, O
   despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to tread under foot
   so precious things, neither yet like dogs to tear and abuse holy
   things. Say not to our Saviour with the Gergesites, Depart out of our
   coast [Matt 8:34]; neither yet with Esau sell your birthright for a
   mess of pottage [Heb 12:16]. If light be come into the world, love not
   darkness more than light; if food, if clothing be offered, go not
   naked, starve not yourselves. Remember the advice of Nazianzene, "It is
   a grievous thing" (or dangerous) "to neglect a great fair, and to seek
   to make markets afterwards: also the encouragement of S. Chrysostom,
   "It is altogether impossible, that he that is sober" (and watchful)
   "should at any time be neglected:" [S. Chrysost. in epist. ad Rom. cap.
   14. oral. 26.] Lastly, the admonition and menacing of S. Augustine,
   "They that despise God's will inviting them, shall feel God's will
   taking vengeance of them." [S. August. ad artic. sibi falso object.
   Artic. 16.] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
   God; [Heb 10:31] but a blessed thing it is, and will bring us to
   everlasting blessedness in the end, when God speaketh unto us, to
   hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to read it; when he
   stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answer, Here am I, here we are
   to do thy will, O God. The Lord work a care and conscience in us to
   know him and serve him, that we may be acknowledged of him at the
   appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the holy Ghost, be all
   praise and thanksgiving.

   Amen.

Genesis

    Chapter 1

   In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

   ^2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the
   face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
   waters.

   ^3And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

   ^4And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light
   from the darkness.

   ^5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And
   the evening and the morning were the first day.

   ^6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,
   and let it divide the waters from the waters.

   ^7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under
   the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it
   was so.

   ^8And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning
   were the second day.

   ^9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
   unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.

   ^10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the
   waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

   ^11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
   seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is
   in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

   ^12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his
   kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his
   kind: and God saw that it was good.

   ^13And the evening and the morning were the third day.

   ^14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to
   divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for
   seasons, and for days, and years:

   ^15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give
   light upon the earth: and it was so.

   ^16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,
   and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

   ^17And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon
   the earth,

   ^18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light
   from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

   ^19And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

   ^20And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
   creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the
   open firmament of heaven.

   ^21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth,
   which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every
   winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

   ^22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
   the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.

   ^23And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

   ^24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after
   his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his
   kind: and it was so.

   ^25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after
   their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his
   kind: and God saw that it was good.

   ^26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and
   let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of
   the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every
   creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

   ^27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he
   him; male and female created he them.

   ^28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
   multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion
   over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every
   living thing that moveth upon the earth.

   ^29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,
   which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which
   is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.

   ^30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and
   to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I
   have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.

   ^31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very
   good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 2

   Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.

   ^2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he
   rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

   ^3And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in
   it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

   ^4These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they
   were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the
   heavens,

   ^5And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every
   herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to
   rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.

   ^6But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face
   of the ground.

   ^7And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed
   into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

   ^8And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put
   the man whom he had formed.

   ^9And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is
   pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the
   midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

   ^10And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it
   was parted, and became into four heads.

   ^11The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the
   whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

   ^12And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx
   stone.

   ^13And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
   compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

   ^14And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth
   toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.

   ^15And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden
   to dress it and to keep it.

   ^16And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
   garden thou mayest freely eat:

   ^17But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not
   eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
   die.

   ^18And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone;
   I will make him an help meet for him.

   ^19And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field,
   and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he
   would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that
   was the name thereof.

   ^20And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and
   to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help
   meet for him.

   ^21And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
   slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead
   thereof;

   ^22And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman,
   and brought her unto the man.

   ^23And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh:
   she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

   ^24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall
   cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

   ^25And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
   ashamed.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 3

   Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the
   Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye
   shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

   ^2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the
   trees of the garden:

   ^3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God
   hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye
   die.

   ^4And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

   ^5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes
   shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

   ^6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it
   was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise,
   she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her
   husband with her; and he did eat.

   ^7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were
   naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.

   ^8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the
   cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence
   of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.

   ^9And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?

   ^10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid,
   because I was naked; and I hid myself.

   ^11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of
   the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?

   ^12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave
   me of the tree, and I did eat.

   ^13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast
   done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

   ^14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this,
   thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field;
   upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of
   thy life:

   ^15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy
   seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his
   heel.

   ^16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
   conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire
   shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.

   ^17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of
   thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,
   saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in
   sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;

   ^18Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou
   shalt eat the herb of the field;

   ^19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto
   the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto
   dust shalt thou return.

   ^20And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of
   all living.

   ^21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins,
   and clothed them.

   ^22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to
   know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also
   of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:

   ^23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to
   till the ground from whence he was taken.

   ^24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of
   Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the
   way of the tree of life.

    Chapter 4

   And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said,
   I have gotten a man from the Lord.

   ^2And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep,
   but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

   ^3And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the
   fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord.

   ^4And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the
   fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering:

   ^5But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was
   very wroth, and his countenance fell.

   ^6And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
   countenance fallen?

   ^7If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not
   well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and
   thou shalt rule over him.

   ^8And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they
   were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew
   him.

   ^9And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said,
   I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?

   ^10And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood
   crieth unto me from the ground.

   ^11And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth
   to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;

   ^12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto
   thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the
   earth.

   ^13And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can
   bear.

   ^14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth;
   and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a
   vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that
   findeth me shall slay me.

   ^15And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
   vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon
   Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

   ^16And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the
   land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

   ^17And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he
   builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his
   son, Enoch.

   ^18And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael
   begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

   ^19And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah,
   and the name of the other Zillah.

   ^20And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents,
   and of such as have cattle.

   ^21And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as
   handle the harp and organ.

   ^22And Zillah, she also bare Tubal- cain, an instructer of every
   artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.

   ^23And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye
   wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my
   wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

   ^24If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
   sevenfold.

   ^25And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his
   name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of
   Abel, whom Cain slew.

   ^26And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his
   name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.

    Chapter 5

   This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God
   created man, in the likeness of God made he him;

   ^2Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their
   name Adam, in the day when they were created.

   ^3And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his
   own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:

   concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which
   the Lord hath cursed.

   ^30And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five

   years: and he died.

   ^32And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and
   Japheth.

    Chapter 6

   And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the
   earth, and daughters were born unto them,

   ^2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair;
   and they took them wives of all which they chose.

   ^3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for
   that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty
   years.

   ^4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,
   when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare
   children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of
   renown.

   ^5And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
   that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
   continually.

   ^6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it
   grieved him at his heart.

   ^7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the
   face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the
   fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.

   ^8But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.

   ^9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in
   his generations, and Noah walked with God.

   ^10And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

   ^11The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with
   violence.

   ^12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all
   flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

   ^13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for
   the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will
   destroy them with the earth.

   ^14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark,
   and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

   ^15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of
   the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits,
   and the height of it thirty cubits.

   ^16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
   finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side
   thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.

   ^17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth,
   to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven;
   and every thing that is in the earth shall die.

   ^18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into
   the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with
   thee.

   ^19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou
   bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male
   and female.

   ^20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every
   creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall
   come unto thee, to keep them alive.

   ^21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt
   gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.

   ^22Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 7

   And the Lord said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark;
   for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.

   ^2Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and
   his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his
   female.

   ^3Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep
   seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

   ^4For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty
   days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will
   I destroy from off the face of the earth.

   ^5And Noah did according unto all that the Lord commanded him.

   ^6And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon
   the earth.

   ^7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives
   with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.

   ^8Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and
   of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,

   ^9There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the
   female, as God had commanded Noah.

   ^10And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood
   were upon the earth.

   ^11In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the
   seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of
   the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.

   ^12And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

   ^13In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,
   the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with
   them, into the ark;

   ^14They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their
   kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his
   kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.

   ^15And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh,
   wherein is the breath of life.

   ^16And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God
   had commanded him: and the Lord shut him in.

   ^17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
   increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.

   ^18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth;
   and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

   ^19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the
   high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.

   ^20Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were
   covered.

   ^21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of
   cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon
   the earth, and every man:

   ^22All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the
   dry land, died.

   ^23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of
   the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl
   of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only
   remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.

   ^24And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 8

   And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle
   that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the
   earth, and the waters asswaged;

   ^2The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were
   stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;

   ^3And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the
   end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.

   ^4And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of
   the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

   ^5And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the
   tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the
   mountains seen.

   ^6And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the
   window of the ark which he had made:

   ^7And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the
   waters were dried up from off the earth.

   ^8Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated
   from off the face of the ground;

   ^9But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned
   unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole
   earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto
   him into the ark.

   ^10And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove
   out of the ark;

   ^11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth
   was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated
   from off the earth.

   ^12And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which
   returned not again unto him any more.

   ^13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the
   first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from
   off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked,
   and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.

   ^14And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the
   month, was the earth dried.

   ^15And God spake unto Noah, saying,

   ^16Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons'
   wives with thee.

   ^17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all
   flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that
   creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth,
   and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.

   ^18And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives
   with him:

   ^19Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever
   creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.

   ^20And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean
   beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the
   altar.

   ^21And the Lord smelled a sweet savour; and the Lord said in his heart,
   I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the
   imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again
   smite any more every thing living, as I have done.

   ^22While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat,
   and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 9

   And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and
   multiply, and replenish the earth.

   ^2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of
   the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon
   the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they
   delivered.

   ^3Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the
   green herb have I given you all things.

   ^4But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye
   not eat.

   ^5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of
   every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of
   every man's brother will I require the life of man.

   ^6Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in
   the image of God made he man.

   ^7And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the
   earth, and multiply therein.

   ^8And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

   ^9And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed
   after you;

   ^10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the
   cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out
   of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

   ^11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh
   be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any
   more be a flood to destroy the earth.

   ^12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between
   me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual
   generations:

   ^13I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a
   covenant between me and the earth.

   ^14And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that
   the bow shall be seen in the cloud:

   ^15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and
   every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become
   a flood to destroy all flesh.

   ^16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I
   may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living
   creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

   ^17And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I
   have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.

   ^18And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and
   Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.

   ^19These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth
   overspread.

   ^20And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

   ^21And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered
   within his tent.

   ^22And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and
   told his two brethren without.

   ^23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their
   shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their
   father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's
   nakedness.

   ^24And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done
   unto him.

   ^25And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be
   unto his brethren.

   ^26And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be
   his servant.

   ^27God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem;
   and Canaan shall be his servant.

   ^28And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

   ^29And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he
   died.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 10

   Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and
   Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

   ^2The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and
   Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

   ^3And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

   ^4And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

   ^5By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every
   one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

   ^6And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

   ^7And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and
   Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.

   ^8And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.

   ^9He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as
   Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord.

   ^10And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad,
   and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

   ^11Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the
   city Rehoboth, and Calah,

   ^12And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.

   ^13And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,

   ^14And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and
   Caphtorim.

   ^15And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,

   ^16And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,

   ^17And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

   ^18And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward
   were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

   ^19And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to
   Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah,
   and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

   ^20These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their
   tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

   ^21Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother
   of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.

   ^22The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and
   Aram.

   ^23And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

   ^24And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

   ^25And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in
   his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.

   ^26And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,

   ^27And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

   ^28And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

   ^29And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of
   Joktan.

   ^30And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount
   of the east.

   ^31These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their
   tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

   ^32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations,
   in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth
   after the flood.

    Chapter 11

   And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

   ^2And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found
   a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.

   ^3And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them
   throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.

   ^4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top
   may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered
   abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

   ^5And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the
   children of men builded.

   ^6And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one
   language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained
   from them, which they have imagined to do.

   ^7Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they
   may not understand one another's speech.

   ^8So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all
   the earth: and they left off to build the city.

   ^9Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there
   confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord
   scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

   ^10These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old,
   and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:

   ^11And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat
   sons and daughters.

   ^12And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:

   ^13And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three
   years, and begat sons and daughters.

   ^14And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:

   ^15And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years,
   and begat sons and daughters.

   ^16And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:

   ^17And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years,
   and begat sons and daughters.

   ^18And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:

   ^19And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and
   begat sons and daughters.

   ^20And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:

   ^21And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and
   begat sons and daughters.

   ^22And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

   ^23And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat
   sons and daughters.

   ^24And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:

   ^25And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years,
   and begat sons and daughters.

   ^26And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

   ^27Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor,
   and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

   ^28And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity,
   in Ur of the Chaldees.

   ^29And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was
   Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the
   father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

   ^30But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

   ^31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's
   son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went
   forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan;
   and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.

   ^32And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah
   died in Haran.

    Chapter 12

   Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from
   thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew
   thee:

   ^2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and
   make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:

   ^3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth
   thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

   ^4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with
   him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of
   Haran.

   ^5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all
   their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had
   gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and
   into the land of Canaan they came.

   ^6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the
   plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.

   ^7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give
   this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared
   unto him.

   ^8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and
   pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and
   there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of
   the Lord.

   ^9And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

   ^10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt
   to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.

   ^11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that
   he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair
   woman to look upon:

   ^12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee,
   that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they
   will save thee alive.

   ^13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me
   for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.

   ^14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
   Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

   ^15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
   Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

   ^16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and
   oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses,
   and camels.

   ^17And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
   because of Sarai Abram's wife.

   ^18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done
   unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?

   ^19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me
   to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.

   ^20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him
   away, and his wife, and all that he had.

    Chapter 13

   And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had,
   and Lot with him, into the south.

   ^2And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

   ^3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the
   place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;

   ^4Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first:
   and there Abram called on the name of the Lord.

   ^5And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and
   tents.

   ^6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
   together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell
   together.

   ^7And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the
   herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled
   then in the land.

   ^8And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between
   me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be
   brethren.

   ^9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,
   from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right;
   or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.

   ^10And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that
   it was well watered every where, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and
   Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as
   thou comest unto Zoar.

   ^11Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east:
   and they separated themselves the one from the other.

   ^12Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities
   of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

   ^13But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord
   exceedingly.

   ^14And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him,
   Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art
   northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:

   ^15For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to
   thy seed for ever.

   ^16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man
   can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.

   ^17Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth
   of it; for I will give it unto thee.

   ^18Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of
   Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord.

    Chapter 14

   And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king
   of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;

   ^2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of
   Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the
   king of Bela, which is Zoar.

   ^3All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the
   salt sea.

   ^4Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year
   they rebelled.

   ^5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were
   with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims
   in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,

   ^6And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the
   wilderness.

   ^7And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote
   all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in
   Hazezontamar.

   ^8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and
   the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the
   same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;

   ^9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations,
   and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings
   with five.

   ^10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom
   and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the
   mountain.

   ^11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their
   victuals, and went their way.

   ^12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and
   his goods, and departed.

   ^13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for
   he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and
   brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.

   ^14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed
   his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and
   eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.

   ^15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night,
   and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand
   of Damascus.

   ^16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his
   brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.

   ^17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the
   slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the
   valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.

   ^18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he
   was the priest of the most high God.

   ^19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God,
   possessor of heaven and earth:

   ^20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies
   into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

   ^21And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take
   the goods to thyself.

   ^22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto
   the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,

   ^23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I
   will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have
   made Abram rich:

   ^24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of
   the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take
   their portion.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 15

   After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision,
   saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great
   reward.

   ^2And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go
   childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?

   ^3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one
   born in my house is mine heir.

   ^4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall
   not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels
   shall be thine heir.

   ^5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven,
   and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto
   him, So shall thy seed be.

   ^6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for
   righteousness.

   ^7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of
   the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

   ^8And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?

   ^9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she
   goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a
   turtledove, and a young pigeon.

   ^10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and
   laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.

   ^11And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them
   away.

   ^12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and,
   lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.

   ^13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a
   stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they
   shall afflict them four hundred years;

   ^14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and
   afterward shall they come out with great substance.

   ^15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a
   good old age.

   ^16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the
   iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

   ^17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark,
   behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those
   pieces.

   ^18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto
   thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great
   river, the river Euphrates:

   ^19The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,

   ^20And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,

   ^21And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the
   Jebusites.

    Chapter 16

   Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid,
   an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

   ^2And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me
   from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may
   obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

   ^3And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram
   had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband
   Abram to be his wife.

   ^4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that
   she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

   ^5And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my
   maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was
   despised in her eyes: the Lord judge between me and thee.

   ^6But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her
   as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled
   from her face.

   ^7And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the
   wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

   ^8And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither
   wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.

   ^9And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and
   submit thyself under her hands.

   ^10And the angel of the Lord said unto her, I will multiply thy seed
   exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

   ^11And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Behold, thou art with
   child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because
   the Lord hath heard thy affliction.

   ^12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and
   every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all
   his brethren.

   ^13And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her, Thou God
   seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth
   me?

   ^14Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between
   Kadesh and Bered.

   ^15And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which
   Hagar bare, Ishmael.

   ^16And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael
   to Abram.

    Chapter 17

   And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to
   Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be
   thou perfect.

   ^2And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply
   thee exceedingly.

   ^3And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,

   ^4As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a
   father of many nations.

   ^5Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall
   be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.

   ^6And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of
   thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

   ^7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed
   after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a
   God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.

   ^8And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land
   wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting
   possession; and I will be their God.

   ^9And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,
   thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.

   ^10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy
   seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.

   ^11And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be
   a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.

   ^12And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every
   man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought
   with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.

   ^13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money,
   must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for
   an everlasting covenant.

   ^14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not
   circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken
   my covenant.

   ^15And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not
   call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.

   ^16And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will
   bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall
   be of her.

   ^17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart,
   Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall
   Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?

   ^18And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!

   ^19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou
   shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him
   for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.

   ^20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him,
   and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve
   princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.

   ^21But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear
   unto thee at this set time in the next year.

   ^22And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.

   ^23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his
   house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the
   men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in
   the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.

   ^24And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised
   in the flesh of his foreskin.

   ^25And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised
   in the flesh of his foreskin.

   ^26In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.

   ^27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with
   money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 18

   And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in
   the tent door in the heat of the day;

   ^2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him:
   and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed
   himself toward the ground,

   ^3And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not
   away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

   ^4Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and
   rest yourselves under the tree:

   ^5And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after
   that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And
   they said, So do, as thou hast said.

   ^6And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready
   quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the
   hearth.

   ^7And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and
   gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.

   ^8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and
   set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did
   eat.

   ^9And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold,
   in the tent.

   ^10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time
   of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it
   in the tent door, which was behind him.

   ^11Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it
   ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

   ^12Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old
   shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?

   ^13And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying,
   Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?

   ^14Is any thing too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed I will
   return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a
   son.

   ^15Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he
   said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

   ^16And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and
   Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

   ^17And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;

   ^18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation,
   and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?

   ^19For I know him, that he will command his children and his household
   after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and
   judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath
   spoken of him.

   ^20And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great,
   and because their sin is very grievous;

   ^21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether
   according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will
   know.

   ^22And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom:
   but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.

   ^23And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
   righteous with the wicked?

   ^24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou
   also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are
   therein?

   ^25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous
   with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that
   be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?

   ^26And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the
   city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

   ^27And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to
   speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:

   ^28Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou
   destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there
   forty and five, I will not destroy it.

   ^29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall
   be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.

   ^30And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will
   speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I
   will not do it, if I find thirty there.

   ^31And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the
   Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I
   will not destroy it for twenty's sake.

   ^32And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but
   this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will
   not destroy it for ten's sake.

   ^33And the Lord went his way, as soon as he had left communing with
   Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

    Chapter 19

   And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of
   Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself
   with his face toward the ground;

   ^2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your
   servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall
   rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will
   abide in the street all night.

   ^3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and
   entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake
   unleavened bread, and they did eat.

   ^4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom,
   compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from
   every quarter:

   ^5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which
   came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know
   them.

   ^6And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,

   ^7And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.

   ^8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I
   pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your
   eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the
   shadow of my roof.

   ^9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came
   in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse
   with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even
   Lot, and came near to break the door.

   ^10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to
   them, and shut to the door.

   ^11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with
   blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to
   find the door.

   ^12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law,
   and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city,
   bring them out of this place:

   ^13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen
   great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy
   it.

   ^14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his
   daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will
   destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in
   law.

   ^15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying,
   Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou
   be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

   ^16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the
   hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord
   being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him
   without the city.

   ^17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that
   he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou
   in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.

   ^18And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:

   ^19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast
   magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life;
   and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:

   ^20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one:
   Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall
   live.

   ^21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this
   thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou
   hast spoken.

   ^22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be
   come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

   ^23The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

   ^24Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire
   from the Lord out of heaven;

   ^25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the
   inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.

   ^26But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of
   salt.

   ^27And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood
   before the Lord:

   ^28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of
   the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the
   smoke of a furnace.

   ^29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,
   that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the
   overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.

   ^30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two
   daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a
   cave, he and his two daughters.

   ^31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and
   there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of
   all the earth:

   ^32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him,
   that we may preserve seed of our father.

   ^33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn
   went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay
   down, nor when she arose.

   ^34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the
   younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him
   drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we
   may preserve seed of our father.

   ^35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the
   younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay
   down, nor when she arose.

   ^36Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.

   ^37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is
   the father of the Moabites unto this day.

   ^38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi:
   the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.

    Chapter 20

   And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled
   between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

   ^2And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech
   king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

   ^3But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,
   Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken;
   for she is a man's wife.

   ^4But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou
   slay also a righteous nation?

   ^5Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself
   said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of
   my hands have I done this.

   ^6And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in
   the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning
   against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.

   ^7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he
   shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not,
   know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.

   ^8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his
   servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were
   sore afraid.

   ^9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done
   unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me
   and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought
   not to be done.

   ^10And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast
   done this thing?

   ^11And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not
   in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.

   ^12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father,
   but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.

   ^13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's
   house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew
   unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my
   brother.

   ^14And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
   womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his
   wife.

   ^15And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it
   pleaseth thee.

   ^16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand
   pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto
   all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.

   ^17So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife,
   and his maidservants; and they bare children.

   ^18For the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
   Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 21

   And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah
   as he had spoken.

   ^2For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the
   set time of which God had spoken to him.

   ^3And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom
   Sarah bare to him, Isaac.

   ^4And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God
   had commanded him.

   ^5And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born
   unto him.

   ^6And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will
   laugh with me.

   ^7And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should
   have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.

   ^8And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast
   the same day that Isaac was weaned.

   ^9And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto
   Abraham, mocking.

   ^10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her
   son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even
   with Isaac.

   ^11And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his
   son.

   ^12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight
   because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah
   hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy
   seed be called.

   ^13And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because
   he is thy seed.

   ^14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a
   bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder,
   and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the
   wilderness of Beersheba.

   ^15And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under
   one of the shrubs.

   ^16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as
   it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child.
   And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.

   ^17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to
   Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear
   not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.

   ^18Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make
   him a great nation.

   ^19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went,
   and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.

   ^20And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness,
   and became an archer.

   ^21And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a
   wife out of the land of Egypt.

   ^22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the
   chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee
   in all that thou doest:

   ^23Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal
   falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according
   to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and
   to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.

   ^24And Abraham said, I will swear.

   ^25And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which
   Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.

   ^26And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither
   didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.

   ^27And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and
   both of them made a covenant.

   ^28And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

   ^29And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs
   which thou hast set by themselves?

   ^30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand,
   that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.

   ^31Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware
   both of them.

   ^32Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and
   Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land
   of the Philistines.

   ^33And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the
   name of the Lord, the everlasting God.

   ^34And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 22

   And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and
   said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.

   ^2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
   lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a
   burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.

   ^3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and
   took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the
   wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of
   which God had told him.

   ^4Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place
   afar off.

   ^5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and
   I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.

   ^6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon
   Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they
   went both of them together.

   ^7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he
   said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but
   where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

   ^8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
   offering: so they went both of them together.

   ^9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham
   built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his
   son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

   ^10And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his
   son.

   ^11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said,
   Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.

   ^12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any
   thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast
   not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.

   ^13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a
   ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the
   ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.

   ^14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is
   said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.

   ^15And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the
   second time,

   ^16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou
   hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:

   ^17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will
   multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is
   upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;

   ^18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
   because thou hast obeyed my voice.

   ^19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went
   together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.

   ^20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham,
   saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother
   Nahor;

   ^21Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of
   Aram,

   ^22And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

   ^23And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor,
   Abraham's brother.

   ^24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and
   Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

    Chapter 23

   And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the
   years of the life of Sarah.

   ^2And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of
   Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.

   ^3And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of
   Heth, saying,

   ^4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a
   buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.

   ^5And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,

   ^6Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of
   our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his
   sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.

   ^7And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land,
   even to the children of Heth.

   ^8And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should
   bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the
   son of Zohar,

   ^9That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in
   the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it
   me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.

   ^10And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite
   answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all
   that went in at the gate of his city, saying,

   ^11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is
   therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give
   I it thee: bury thy dead.

   ^12And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.

   ^13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land,
   saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give
   thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.

   ^14And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,

   ^15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of
   silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.

   ^16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the
   silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four
   hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.

   ^17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before
   Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees
   that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were
   made sure

   ^18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of
   Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.

   ^19And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the
   field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of
   Canaan.

   ^20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto
   Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 24

   And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the Lord had blessed
   Abraham in all things.

   ^2And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled
   over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:

   ^3And I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the
   God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the
   daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:

   ^4But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife
   unto my son Isaac.

   ^5And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be
   willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again
   unto the land from whence thou camest?

   ^6And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son
   thither again.

   ^7The Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and
   from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware
   unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his
   angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.

   ^8And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt
   be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.

   ^9And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master,
   and sware to him concerning that matter.

   ^10And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and
   departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he
   arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.

   ^11And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of
   water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to
   draw water.

   ^12And he said, O Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me
   good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.

   ^13Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the
   men of the city come out to draw water:

   ^14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let
   down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say,
   Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that
   thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know
   that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.

   ^15And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,
   Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of
   Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.

   ^16And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any
   man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher,
   and came up.

   ^17And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,
   drink a little water of thy pitcher.

   ^18And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her
   pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.

   ^19And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water
   for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.

   ^20And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran
   again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.

   ^21And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the Lord
   had made his journey prosperous or not.

   ^22And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man
   took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for
   her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;

   ^23And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there
   room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?

   ^24And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of
   Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.

   ^25She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough,
   and room to lodge in.

   ^26And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the Lord.

   ^27And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath
   not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the
   way, the Lord led me to the house of my master's brethren.

   ^28And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these
   things.

   ^29And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out
   unto the man, unto the well.

   ^30And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his
   sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister,
   saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and,
   behold, he stood by the camels at the well.

   ^31And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; wherefore standest
   thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.

   ^32And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and
   gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet,
   and the men's feet that were with him.

   ^33And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not
   eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.

   ^34And he said, I am Abraham's servant.

   ^35And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great:
   and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and
   menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.

   ^36And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old:
   and unto him hath he given all that he hath.

   ^37And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to
   my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:

   ^38But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and
   take a wife unto my son.

   ^39And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow
   me.

   ^40And he said unto me, The Lord, before whom I walk, will send his
   angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my
   son of my kindred, and of my father's house:

   ^41Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my
   kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my
   oath.

   ^42And I came this day unto the well, and said, O Lord God of my master
   Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:

   ^43Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass,
   that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give
   me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;

   ^44And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy
   camels: let the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed out for
   my master's son.

   ^45And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came
   forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the
   well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.

   ^46And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and
   said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she
   made the camels drink also.

   ^47And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said,
   The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I
   put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.

   ^48And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the Lord, and blessed the
   Lord God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to
   take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.

   ^49And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me:
   and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.

   ^50Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from
   the Lord: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.

   ^51Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy
   master's son's wife, as the Lord hath spoken.

   ^52And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words,
   he worshipped the Lord, bowing himself to the earth.

   ^53And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
   and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and
   to her mother precious things.

   ^54And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and
   tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send
   me away unto my master.

   ^55And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a
   few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.

   ^56And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the Lord hath prospered
   my way; send me away that I may go to my master.

   ^57And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.

   ^58And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this
   man? And she said, I will go.

   ^59And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and
   Abraham's servant, and his men.

   ^60And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be
   thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the
   gate of those which hate them.

   ^61And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels,
   and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.

   ^62And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in
   the south country.

   ^63And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he
   lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.

   ^64And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted
   off the camel.

   ^65For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in
   the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master:
   therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.

   ^66And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

   ^67And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took
   Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was
   comforted after his mother's death.

    Chapter 25

   Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.

   ^2And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and
   Ishbak, and Shuah.

   ^3And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were
   Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

   ^4And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and
   Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.

   ^5And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.

   ^6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave
   gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,
   eastward, unto the east country.

   ^7And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived,
   an hundred threescore and fifteen years.

   ^8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old
   man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.

   ^9And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah,
   in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before
   Mamre;

   ^10The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was
   Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

   ^11And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his
   son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.

   ^12Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar
   the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:

   ^13And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names,
   according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and
   Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

   ^14And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

   ^15Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:

   ^16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their
   towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.

   ^17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and
   thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was
   gathered unto his people.

   ^18And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou
   goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.

   ^19And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat
   Isaac:

   ^20And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the
   daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the
   Syrian.

   ^21And Isaac intreated the Lord for his wife, because she was barren:
   and the Lord was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.

   ^22And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it
   be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the Lord.

   ^23And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two
   manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people
   shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the
   younger.

   ^24And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were
   twins in her womb.

   ^25And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they
   called his name Esau.

   ^26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on
   Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore
   years old when she bare them.

   ^27And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the
   field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.

   ^28And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah
   loved Jacob.

   ^29And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was
   faint:

   ^30And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red
   pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.

   ^31And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.

   ^32And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit
   shall this birthright do to me?

   ^33And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he
   sold his birthright unto Jacob.

   ^34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat
   and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his
   birthright.

    Chapter 26

   And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in
   the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the
   Philistines unto Gerar.

   ^2And the Lord appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt;
   dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:

   ^3Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee;
   for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and
   I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;

   ^4And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will
   give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the
   nations of the earth be blessed;

   ^5Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my
   commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

   ^6And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:

   ^7And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is
   my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men
   of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look
   upon.

   ^8And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that
   Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and,
   behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.

   ^9And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy
   wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him,
   Because I said, Lest I die for her.

   ^10And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the
   people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have
   brought guiltiness upon us.

   ^11And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this
   man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

   ^12Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an
   hundredfold: and the Lord blessed him.

   ^13And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became
   very great:

   ^14For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great
   store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.

   ^15For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days
   of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled
   them with earth.

   ^16And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much
   mightier than we.

   ^17And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of
   Gerar, and dwelt there.

   ^18And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in
   the days of Abraham his father; for the philistines had stopped them
   after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names
   by which his father had called them.

   ^19And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of
   springing water.

   ^20And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying,
   The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because
   they strove with him.

   ^21And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he
   called the name of it Sitnah.

   ^22And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that
   they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said,
   For now the Lord hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the
   land.

   ^23And he went up from thence to Beersheba.

   ^24And the Lord appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the
   God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless
   thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.

   ^25And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the Lord,
   and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.

   ^26Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his
   friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.

   ^27And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate
   me, and have sent me away from you?

   ^28And they said, We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee: and we
   said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee,
   and let us make a covenant with thee;

   ^29That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we
   have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace:
   thou art now the blessed of the Lord.

   ^30And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.

   ^31And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another:
   and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.

   ^32And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and
   told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him,
   We have found water.

   ^33And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba
   unto this day.

   ^34And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the
   daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the
   Hittite:

   ^35Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 27

   And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so
   that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto
   him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.

   ^2And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:

   ^3Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow,
   and go out to the field, and take me some venison;

   ^4And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I
   may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.

   ^5And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to
   the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.

   ^6And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy
   father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,

   ^7Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless
   thee before the Lord before my death.

   ^8Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I
   command thee.

   ^9Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the
   goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he
   loveth:

   ^10And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he
   may bless thee before his death.

   ^11And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a
   hairy man, and I am a smooth man:

   ^12My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a
   deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.

   ^13And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only
   obey my voice, and go fetch me them.

   ^14And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his
   mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.

   ^15And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were
   with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:

   ^16And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and
   upon the smooth of his neck:

   ^17And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared,
   into the hand of her son Jacob.

   ^18And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here
   am I; who art thou, my son?

   ^19And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done
   according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my
   venison, that thy soul may bless me.

   ^20And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so
   quickly, my son? And he said, Because the Lord thy God brought it to
   me.

   ^21And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel
   thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.

   ^22And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and
   said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.

   ^23And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his
   brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.

   ^24And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.

   ^25And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's
   venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him,
   and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.

   ^26And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my
   son.

   ^27And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his
   raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the
   smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed:

   ^28Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the
   earth, and plenty of corn and wine:

   ^29Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over
   thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be
   every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.

   ^30And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing
   Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his
   father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.

   ^31And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father,
   and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's
   venison, that thy soul may bless me.

   ^32And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am
   thy son, thy firstborn Esau.

   ^33And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that
   hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before
   thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.

   ^34And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great
   and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me
   also, O my father.

   ^35And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy
   blessing.

   ^36And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted
   me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he
   hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a
   blessing for me?

   ^37And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy
   lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with
   corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee,
   my son?

   ^38And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my
   father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his
   voice, and wept.

   ^39And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy
   dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven
   from above;

   ^40And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and
   it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou
   shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.

   ^41And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father
   blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my
   father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.

   ^42And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she
   sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy
   brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill
   thee.

   ^43Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban
   my brother to Haran;

   ^44And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away;

   ^45Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that
   which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from
   thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?

   ^46And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the
   daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such
   as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my
   life do me?
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 28

   And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto
   him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.

   ^2Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father;
   and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's
   brother.

   ^3And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply
   thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;

   ^4And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with
   thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger,
   which God gave unto Abraham.

   ^5And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son
   of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's
   mother.

   ^6When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to
   Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him
   he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the
   daughters of Canaan;

   ^7And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to
   Padanaram;

   ^8And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his
   father;

   ^9Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had
   Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth,
   to be his wife.

   ^10And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.

   ^11And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night,
   because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and
   put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.

   ^12And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top
   of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and
   descending on it.

   ^13And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the Lord God of
   Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest,
   to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;

   ^14And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt
   spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to
   the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the
   earth be blessed.

   ^15And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places
   whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I
   will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee
   of.

   ^16And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is
   in this place; and I knew it not.

   ^17And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is
   none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.

   ^18And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he
   had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil
   upon the top of it.

   ^19And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that
   city was called Luz at the first.

   ^20And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep
   me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to
   put on,

   ^21So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the
   Lord be my God:

   ^22And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house:
   and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto
   thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 29

   Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of
   the east.

   ^2And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were
   three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered
   the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.

   ^3And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone
   from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again
   upon the well's mouth in his place.

   ^4And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said,
   Of Haran are we.

   ^5And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said,
   We know him.

   ^6And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and,
   behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.

   ^7And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the
   cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed
   them.

   ^8And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together,
   and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the
   sheep.

   ^9And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's
   sheep: for she kept them.

   ^10And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his
   mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that
   Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and
   watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.

   ^11And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.

   ^12And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he
   was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.

   ^13And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his
   sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed
   him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.

   ^14And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he
   abode with him the space of a month.

   ^15And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest
   thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be?

   ^16And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the
   name of the younger was Rachel.

   ^17Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.

   ^18And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for
   Rachel thy younger daughter.

   ^19And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I
   should give her to another man: abide with me.

   ^20And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him
   but a few days, for the love he had to her.

   ^21And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are
   fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.

   ^22And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a
   feast.

   ^23And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter,
   and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.

   ^24And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an
   handmaid.

   ^25And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and
   he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve
   with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?

   ^26And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the
   younger before the firstborn.

   ^27Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service
   which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.

   ^28And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his
   daughter to wife also.

   ^29And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her
   maid.

   ^30And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than
   Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.

   ^31And when the Lord saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but
   Rachel was barren.

   ^32And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben:
   for she said, Surely the Lord hath looked upon my affliction; now
   therefore my husband will love me.

   ^33And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the Lord
   hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also:
   and she called his name Simeon.

   ^34And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time
   will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons:
   therefore was his name called Levi.

   ^35And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I
   praise the Lord: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 30

   And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her
   sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.

   ^2And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in
   God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?

   ^3And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall
   bear upon my knees that I may also have children by her.

   ^4And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto
   her.

   ^5And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.

   ^6And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice,
   and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.

   ^7And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second
   son.

   ^8And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my
   sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.

   ^9When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid,
   and gave her Jacob to wife.

   ^10And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.

   ^11And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.

   ^12And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.

   ^13And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed:
   and she called his name Asher.

   ^14And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in
   the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to
   Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.

   ^15And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my
   husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And
   Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's
   mandrakes.

   ^16And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to
   meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired
   thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.

   ^17And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the
   fifth son.

   ^18And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my
   maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.

   ^19And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.

   ^20And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my
   husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called
   his name Zebulun.

   ^21And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.

   ^22And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her
   womb.

   ^23And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my
   reproach:

   ^24And she called his name Joseph; and said, The Lord shall add to me
   another son.

   ^25And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said
   unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my
   country.

   ^26Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and
   let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.

   ^27And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in
   thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the Lord hath
   blessed me for thy sake.

   ^28And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.

   ^29And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how
   thy cattle was with me.

   ^30For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now
   increased unto a multitude; and the Lord hath blessed thee since my
   coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?

   ^31And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not
   give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed
   and keep thy flock:

   ^32I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all
   the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the
   sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall
   be my hire.

   ^33So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it
   shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled
   and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be
   counted stolen with me.

   ^34And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.

   ^35And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and
   spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and
   every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep,
   and gave them into the hand of his sons.

   ^36And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob
   fed the rest of Laban's flocks.

   ^37And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and
   chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white
   appear which was in the rods.

   ^38And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the
   gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that
   they should conceive when they came to drink.

   ^39And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle
   ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.

   ^40And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks
   toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he
   put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle.

   ^41And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive,
   that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters,
   that they might conceive among the rods.

   ^42But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler
   were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.

   ^43And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and
   maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

    Chapter 31

   And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away
   all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he
   gotten all this glory.

   ^2And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not
   toward him as before.

   ^3And the Lord said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers,
   and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.

   ^4And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his
   flock,

   ^5And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not
   toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me.

   ^6And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.

   ^7And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but
   God suffered him not to hurt me.

   ^8If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle
   bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire;
   then bare all the cattle ringstraked.

   ^9Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to
   me.

   ^10And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I
   lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which
   leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.

   ^11And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I
   said, Here am I.

   ^12And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which
   leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have
   seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

   ^13I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where
   thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and
   return unto the land of thy kindred.

   ^14And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any
   portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?

   ^15Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath
   quite devoured also our money.

   ^16For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is
   ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee,
   do.

   ^17Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;

   ^18And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had
   gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram,
   for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.

   ^19And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images
   that were her father's.

   ^20And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told
   him not that he fled.

   ^21So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the
   river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.

   ^22And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.

   ^23And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days'
   journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.

   ^24And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto
   him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

   ^25Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the
   mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.

   ^26And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen
   away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken
   with the sword?

   ^27Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and
   didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and
   with songs, with tabret, and with harp?

   ^28And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast
   now done foolishly in so doing.

   ^29It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your
   father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou
   speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

   ^30And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore
   longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my
   gods?

   ^31And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I
   said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.

   ^32With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our
   brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For
   Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.

   ^33And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the
   two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of
   Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

   ^34Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's
   furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but
   found them not.

   ^35And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I
   cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he
   searched, but found not the images.

   ^36And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and
   said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so
   hotly pursued after me?

   ^37Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all
   thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren,
   that they may judge betwixt us both.

   ^38This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats
   have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.

   ^39That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the
   loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or
   stolen by night.

   ^40Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by
   night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.

   ^41Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen
   years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou
   hast changed my wages ten times.

   ^42Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of
   Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God
   hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee
   yesternight.

   ^43And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my
   daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my
   cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day
   unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?

   ^44Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let
   it be for a witness between me and thee.

   ^45And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

   ^46And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took
   stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.

   ^47And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.

   ^48And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day.
   Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;

   ^49And Mizpah; for he said, The Lord watch between me and thee, when we
   are absent one from another.

   ^50If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other
   wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness
   betwixt me and thee.

   ^51And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar,
   which I have cast betwixt me and thee;

   ^52This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not
   pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this
   heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.

   ^53The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father,
   judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.

   ^54Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren
   to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the
   mount.

   ^55And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his
   daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his
   place.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 32

   And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

   ^2And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called
   the name of that place Mahanaim.

   ^3And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the
   land of Seir, the country of Edom.

   ^4And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau;
   Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed
   there until now:

   ^5And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and
   womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace
   in thy sight.

   ^6And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother
   Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.

   ^7Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the
   people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels,
   into two bands;

   ^8And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the
   other company which is left shall escape.

   ^9And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father
   Isaac, the Lord which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to
   thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:

   ^10I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the
   truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I
   passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.

   ^11Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand
   of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother
   with the children.

   ^12And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as
   the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.

   ^13And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to
   his hand a present for Esau his brother;

   ^14Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and
   twenty rams,

   ^15Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls,
   twenty she asses, and ten foals.

   ^16And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by
   themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a
   space betwixt drove and drove.

   ^17And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth
   thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou?
   and whose are these before thee?

   ^18Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present
   sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.

   ^19And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed
   the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye
   find him.

   ^20And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he
   said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and
   afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.

   ^21So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night
   in the company.

   ^22And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
   womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.

   ^23And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that
   he had.

   ^24And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until
   the breaking of the day.

   ^25And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the
   hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint,
   as he wrestled with him.

   ^26And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will
   not let thee go, except thou bless me.

   ^27And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.

   ^28And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for
   as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.

   ^29And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And
   he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he
   blessed him there.

   ^30And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God
   face to face, and my life is preserved.

   ^31And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted
   upon his thigh.

   ^32Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank,
   which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he
   touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 33

   And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and
   with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and
   unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.

   ^2And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and
   her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.

   ^3And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven
   times, until he came near to his brother.

   ^4And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and
   kissed him: and they wept.

   ^5And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and
   said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath
   graciously given thy servant.

   ^6Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they
   bowed themselves.

   ^7And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and
   after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.

   ^8And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he
   said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.

   ^9And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto
   thyself.

   ^10And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy
   sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen
   thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased
   with me.

   ^11Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God
   hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged
   him, and he took it.

   ^12And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go
   before thee.

   ^13And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender,
   and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should
   overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.

   ^14Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will
   lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the
   children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.

   ^15And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are
   with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight
   of my lord.

   ^16So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.

   ^17And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made
   booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called
   Succoth.

   ^18And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of
   Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the
   city.

   ^19And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at
   the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred
   pieces of money.

   ^20And he erected there an altar, and called it Elelohe-Israel.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 34

   And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to
   see the daughters of the land.

   ^2And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country,
   saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.

   ^3And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the
   damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.

   ^4And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel
   to wife.

   ^5And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons
   were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they
   were come.

   ^6And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with
   him.

   ^7And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and
   the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought
   folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not
   to be done.

   ^8And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem
   longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.

   ^9And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and
   take our daughters unto you.

   ^10And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell
   and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.

   ^11And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find
   grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.

   ^12Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye
   shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.

   ^13And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father
   deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:

   ^14And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister
   to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:

   ^15But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that
   every male of you be circumcised;

   ^16Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your
   daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one
   people.

   ^17But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we
   take our daughter, and we will be gone.

   ^18And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.

   ^19And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had
   delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the
   house of his father.

   ^20And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and
   communed with the men of their city, saying,

   ^21These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the
   land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for
   them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them
   our daughters.

   ^22Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be
   one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are
   circumcised.

   ^23Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs
   be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.

   ^24And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out
   of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went
   out of the gate of his city.

   ^25And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two
   of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man
   his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.

   ^26And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword,
   and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.

   ^27The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because
   they had defiled their sister.

   ^28They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that
   which was in the city, and that which was in the field,

   ^29And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives
   took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.

   ^30And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to
   stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the
   Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves
   together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my
   house.

   ^31And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 35

   And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and
   make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou
   fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.

   ^2Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him,
   Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change
   your garments:

   ^3And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar
   unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in
   the way which I went.

   ^4And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their
   hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid
   them under the oak which was by Shechem.

   ^5And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that
   were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.

   ^6So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,
   Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.

   ^7And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because
   there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.

   ^8But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel
   under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.

   ^9And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and
   blessed him.

   ^10And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be
   called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his
   name Israel.

   ^11And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply;
   a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall
   come out of thy loins;

   ^12And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it,
   and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

   ^13And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.

   ^14And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,
   even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he
   poured oil thereon.

   ^15And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him,
   Bethel.

   ^16And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to
   come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.

   ^17And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife
   said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.

   ^18And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died)
   that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.

   ^19And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is
   Bethlehem.

   ^20And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of
   Rachel's grave unto this day.

   ^21And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.

   ^22And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben
   went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it.
   Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:

   ^23The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi,
   and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:

   ^24The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:

   ^25And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:

   ^26And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these are
   the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.

   ^27And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of
   Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

   ^28And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.

   ^29And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his
   people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried
   him.

    Chapter 36

   Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.

   ^2Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of
   Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of
   Zibeon the Hivite;

   ^3And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.

   ^4And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;

   ^5And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons
   of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.

   ^6And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the
   persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his
   substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the
   country from the face of his brother Jacob.

   ^7For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and
   the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of
   their cattle.

   ^8Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

   ^9And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in
   mount Seir:

   ^10These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife
   of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.

   ^11And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and
   Kenaz.

   ^12And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to
   Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.

   ^13And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and
   Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.

   ^14And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the
   daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and
   Jaalam, and Korah.

   ^15These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the
   firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,

   ^16Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that
   came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.

   ^17And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah,
   duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in
   the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.

   ^18And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke
   Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the
   daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.

   ^19These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes.

   ^20These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land;
   Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,

   ^21And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the
   Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.

   ^22And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister
   was Timna.

   ^23And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and
   Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.

   ^24And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was
   that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses
   of Zibeon his father.

   ^25And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the
   daughter of Anah.

   ^26And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and
   Ithran, and Cheran.

   ^27The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.

   ^28The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.

   ^29These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke
   Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,

   ^30Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came
   of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.

   ^31And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before
   there reigned any king over the children of Israel.

   ^32And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city
   was Dinhabah.

   ^33And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his
   stead.

   ^34And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his
   stead.

   ^35And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the
   field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was
   Avith.

   ^36And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.

   ^37And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his
   stead.

   ^38And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.

   ^39And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his
   stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was
   Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.

   ^40And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to
   their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke
   Alvah, duke Jetheth,

   ^41Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,

   ^42Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,

   ^43Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to
   their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the
   father of the Edomites.

    Chapter 37

   And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the
   land of Canaan.

   ^2These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years
   old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the
   sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and
   Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.

   ^3Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was
   the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.

   ^4And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all
   his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.

   ^5And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they
   hated him yet the more.

   ^6And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have
   dreamed:

   ^7For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf
   arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round
   about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.

   ^8And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or
   shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the
   more for his dreams, and for his words.

   ^9And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said,
   Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon
   and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.

   ^10And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father
   rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast
   dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow
   down ourselves to thee to the earth?

   ^11And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.

   ^12And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.

   ^13And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in
   Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here
   am I.

   ^14And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy
   brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent
   him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

   ^15And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the
   field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?

   ^16And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they
   feed their flocks.

   ^17And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let
   us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in
   Dothan.

   ^18And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them,
   they conspired against him to slay him.

   ^19And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.

   ^20Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit,
   and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see
   what will become of his dreams.

   ^21And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and
   said, Let us not kill him.

   ^22And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit
   that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid
   him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.

   ^23And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that
   they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was
   on him;

   ^24And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty,
   there was no water in it.

   ^25And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and
   looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with
   their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down
   to Egypt.

   ^26And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our
   brother, and conceal his blood?

   ^27Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand
   be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were
   content.

   ^28Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and
   lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for
   twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.

   ^29And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the
   pit; and he rent his clothes.

   ^30And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and
   I, whither shall I go?

   ^31And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and
   dipped the coat in the blood;

   ^32And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their
   father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's
   coat or no.

   ^33And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath
   devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.

   ^34And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and
   mourned for his son many days.

   ^35And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but
   he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the
   grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.

   ^36And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of
   Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

    Chapter 38

   And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his
   brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.

   ^2And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was
   Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.

   ^3And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.

   ^4And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name
   Onan.

   ^5And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name
   Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.

   ^6And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.

   ^7And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and
   the Lord slew him.

   ^8And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry
   her, and raise up seed to thy brother.

   ^9And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass,
   when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the
   ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.

   ^10And the thing which he did displeased the Lord: wherefore he slew
   him also.

   ^11Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy
   father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest
   peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt
   in her father's house.

   ^12And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and
   Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he
   and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

   ^13And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to
   Timnath to shear his sheep.

   ^14And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with
   a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the
   way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not
   given unto him to wife.

   ^15When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had
   covered her face.

   ^16And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let
   me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in
   law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in
   unto me?

   ^17And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said,
   Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?

   ^18And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy
   signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he
   gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.

   ^19And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put
   on the garments of her widowhood.

   ^20And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to
   receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.

   ^21Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot,
   that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in
   this place.

   ^22And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the
   men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.

   ^23And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I
   sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.

   ^24And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told
   Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and
   also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her
   forth, and let her be burnt.

   ^25When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying,
   By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I
   pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.

   ^26And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous
   than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her
   again no more.

   ^27And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins
   were in her womb.

   ^28And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his
   hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread,
   saying, This came out first.

   ^29And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his
   brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach
   be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.

   ^30And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon
   his hand: and his name was called Zarah.

    Chapter 39

   And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of
   Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of
   the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.

   ^2And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was
   in the house of his master the Egyptian.

   ^3And his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made
   all that he did to prosper in his hand.

   ^4And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made
   him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.

   ^5And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in
   his house, and over all that he had, that the Lord blessed the
   Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the Lord was
   upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.

   ^6And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought
   he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly
   person, and well favoured.

   ^7And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast
   her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.

   ^8But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master
   wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all
   that he hath to my hand;

   ^9There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back
   any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I
   do this great wickedness, and sin against God?

   ^10And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he
   hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.

   ^11And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house
   to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there
   within.

   ^12And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left
   his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.

   ^13And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in
   her hand, and was fled forth,

   ^14That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them,
   saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came
   in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:

   ^15And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and
   cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.

   ^16And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.

   ^17And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew
   servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:

   ^18And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left
   his garment with me, and fled out.

   ^19And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife,
   which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to
   me; that his wrath was kindled.

   ^20And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place
   where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.

   ^21But the Lord was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him
   favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

   ^22And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the
   prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he
   was the doer of it.

   ^23The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his
   hand; because the Lord was with him, and that which he did, the Lord
   made it to prosper.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 40

   And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of
   Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.

   ^2And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief
   of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.

   ^3And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,
   into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.

   ^4And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served
   them: and they continued a season in ward.

   ^5And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one
   night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the
   butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the
   prison.

   ^6And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them,
   and, behold, they were sad.

   ^7And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his
   lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?

   ^8And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no
   interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations
   belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.

   ^9And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my
   dream, behold, a vine was before me;

   ^10And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded,
   and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth
   ripe grapes:

   ^11And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed
   them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.

   ^12And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The
   three branches are three days:

   ^13Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore
   thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his
   hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.

   ^14But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness,
   I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me
   out of this house:

   ^15For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and
   here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.

   ^16When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said
   unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white
   baskets on my head:

   ^17And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for
   Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.

   ^18And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof:
   The three baskets are three days:

   ^19Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee,
   and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from
   off thee.

   ^20And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday,
   that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head
   of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.

   ^21And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he
   gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:

   ^22But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.

   ^23Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 41

   And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed:
   and, behold, he stood by the river.

   ^2And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine
   and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.

   ^3And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river,
   ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the
   brink of the river.

   ^4And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well
   favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.

   ^5And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of
   corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

   ^6And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up
   after them.

   ^7And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And
   Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.

   ^8And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and
   he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men
   thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could
   interpret them unto Pharaoh.

   ^9Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my
   faults this day:

   ^10Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the
   captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:

   ^11And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man
   according to the interpretation of his dream.

   ^12And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the
   captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our
   dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.

   ^13And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
   restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.

   ^14Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily
   out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and
   came in unto Pharaoh.

   ^15And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is
   none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou
   canst understand a dream to interpret it.

   ^16And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give
   Pharaoh an answer of peace.

   ^17And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the
   bank of the river:

   ^18And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed
   and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:

   ^19And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill
   favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt
   for badness:

   ^20And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven
   fat kine:

   ^21And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had
   eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I
   awoke.

   ^22And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk,
   full and good:

   ^23And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east
   wind, sprung up after them:

   ^24And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto
   the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.

   ^25And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath
   shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.

   ^26The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are
   seven years: the dream is one.

   ^27And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are
   seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall
   be seven years of famine.

   ^28This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is
   about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.

   ^29Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the
   land of Egypt:

   ^30And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the
   plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall
   consume the land;

   ^31And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that
   famine following; for it shall be very grievous.

   ^32And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because
   the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.

   ^33Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set
   him over the land of Egypt.

   ^34Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and
   take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous
   years.

   ^35And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and
   lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the
   cities.

   ^36And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years
   of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish
   not through the famine.

   ^37And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of
   all his servants.

   ^38And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this
   is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?

   ^39And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all
   this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:

   ^40Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all
   my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.

   ^41And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land
   of Egypt.

   ^42And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon
   Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a
   gold chain about his neck;

   ^43And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they
   cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land
   of Egypt.

   ^44And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall
   no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.

   ^45And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to
   wife Asenath the daughter of Poti- pherah priest of On. And Joseph went
   out over all the land of Egypt.

   ^46And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of
   Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went
   throughout all the land of Egypt.

   ^47And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
   handfuls.

   ^48And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in
   the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the
   field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.

   ^49And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he
   left numbering; for it was without number.

   ^50And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came,
   which Asenath the daughter of Poti- pherah priest of On bare unto him.

   ^51And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said
   he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.

   ^52And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me
   to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

   ^53And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt,
   were ended.

   ^54And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had
   said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt
   there was bread.

   ^55And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to
   Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto
   Joseph; what he saith to you, do.

   ^56And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened
   all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed
   sore in the land of Egypt.

   ^57And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because
   that the famine was so sore in all lands.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 42

   Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his
   sons, Why do ye look one upon another?

   ^2And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get
   you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not
   die.

   ^3And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

   ^4But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for
   he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.

   ^5And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for
   the famine was in the land of Canaan.

   ^6And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to
   all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down
   themselves before him with their faces to the earth.

   ^7And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself
   strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them,
   Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.

   ^8And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.

   ^9And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said
   unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.

   ^10And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy
   servants come.

   ^11We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no
   spies.

   ^12And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye
   are come.

   ^13And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man
   in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our
   father, and one is not.

   ^14And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying,
   Ye are spies:

   ^15Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go
   forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

   ^16Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be
   kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any
   truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.

   ^17And he put them all together into ward three days.

   ^18And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I
   fear God:

   ^19If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of
   your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:

   ^20But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be
   verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

   ^21And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our
   brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us,
   and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.

   ^22And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do
   not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold,
   also his blood is required.

   ^23And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto
   them by an interpreter.

   ^24And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to
   them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and
   bound him before their eyes.

   ^25Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore
   every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the
   way: and thus did he unto them.

   ^26And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.

   ^27And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the
   inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.

   ^28And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is
   even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid,
   saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?

   ^29And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and
   told him all that befell unto them; saying,

   ^30The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took
   us for spies of the country.

   ^31And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:

   ^32We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the
   youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

   ^33And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I
   know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and
   take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:

   ^34And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye
   are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your
   brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.

   ^35And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every
   man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their
   father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.

   ^36And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my
   children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin
   away: all these things are against me.

   ^37And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I
   bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him
   to thee again.

   ^38And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is
   dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the
   which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the
   grave.

    Chapter 43

   And the famine was sore in the land.

   ^2And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had
   brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a
   little food.

   ^3And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto
   us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.

   ^4If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee
   food:

   ^5But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said
   unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.

   ^6And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the
   man whether ye had yet a brother?

   ^7And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our
   kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and
   we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly
   know that he would say, Bring your brother down?

   ^8And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we
   will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou,
   and also our little ones.

   ^9I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I
   bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the
   blame for ever:

   ^10For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second
   time.

   ^11And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do
   this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry
   down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and
   myrrh, nuts, and almonds:

   ^12And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought
   again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand;
   peradventure it was an oversight:

   ^13Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:

   ^14And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send
   away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children,
   I am bereaved.

   ^15And the men took that present, and they took double money in their
   hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood
   before Joseph.

   ^16And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his
   house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men
   shall dine with me at noon.

   ^17And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into
   Joseph's house.

   ^18And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's
   house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our
   sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion
   against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.

   ^19And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they
   communed with him at the door of the house,

   ^20And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:

   ^21And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our
   sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our
   money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.

   ^22And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we
   cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.

   ^23And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of
   your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.
   And he brought Simeon out unto them.

   ^24And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them
   water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.

   ^25And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for
   they heard that they should eat bread there.

   ^26And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in
   their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.

   ^27And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well,
   the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?

   ^28And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is
   yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.

   ^29And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his
   mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake
   unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.

   ^30And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother:
   and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept
   there.

   ^31And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and
   said, Set on bread.

   ^32And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and
   for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the
   Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an
   abomination unto the Egyptians.

   ^33And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright,
   and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at
   another.

   ^34And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but
   Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they
   drank, and were merry with him.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 44

   And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks
   with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his
   sack's mouth.

   ^2And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest,
   and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had
   spoken.

   ^3As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and
   their asses.

   ^4And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph
   said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost
   overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?

   ^5Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he
   divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

   ^6And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.

   ^7And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God
   forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:

   ^8Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought
   again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out
   of thy lord's house silver or gold?

   ^9With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we
   also will be my lord's bondmen.

   ^10And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with
   whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.

   ^11Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and
   opened every man his sack.

   ^12And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest:
   and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

   ^13Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and
   returned to the city.

   ^14And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet
   there: and they fell before him on the ground.

   ^15And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot
   ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?

   ^16And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?
   or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy
   servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with
   whom the cup is found.

   ^17And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose
   hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you
   up in peace unto your father.

   ^18Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy
   servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine
   anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.

   ^19My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?

   ^20And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child
   of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is
   left of his mother, and his father loveth him.

   ^21And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I
   may set mine eyes upon him.

   ^22And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he
   should leave his father, his father would die.

   ^23And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come
   down with you, ye shall see my face no more.

   ^24And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we
   told him the words of my lord.

   ^25And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.

   ^26And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us,
   then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our
   youngest brother be with us.

   ^27And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me
   two sons:

   ^28And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in
   pieces; and I saw him not since:

   ^29And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall
   bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

   ^30Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be
   not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;

   ^31It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us,
   that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of
   thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.

   ^32For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If
   I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for
   ever.

   ^33Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad
   a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.

   ^34For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest
   peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 45

   Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by
   him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood
   no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.

   ^2And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.

   ^3And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet
   live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at
   his presence.

   ^4And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And
   they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold
   into Egypt.

   ^5Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold
   me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.

   ^6For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there
   are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.

   ^7And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth,
   and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

   ^8So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made
   me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler
   throughout all the land of Egypt.

   ^9Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy
   son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me,
   tarry not:

   ^10And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near
   unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy
   flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:

   ^11And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of
   famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to
   poverty.

   ^12And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,
   that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.

   ^13And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all
   that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.

   ^14And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin
   wept upon his neck.

   ^15Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after
   that his brethren talked with him.

   ^16And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's
   brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.

   ^17And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;
   lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;

   ^18And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I
   will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat
   of the land.

   ^19Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land
   of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your
   father, and come.

   ^20Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is
   yours.

   ^21And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,
   according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for
   the way.

   ^22To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin
   he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.

   ^23And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with
   the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread
   and meat for his father by the way.

   ^24So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto
   them, See that ye fall not out by the way.

   ^25And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto
   Jacob their father,

   ^26And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over
   all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them
   not.

   ^27And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto
   them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him,
   the spirit of Jacob their father revived:

   ^28And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go
   and see him before I die.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 46

   And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to
   Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.

   ^2And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,
   Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.

   ^3And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down
   into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:

   ^4I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring
   thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.

   ^5And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried
   Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the
   wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

   ^6And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in
   the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with
   him:

   ^7His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons'
   daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.

   ^8And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into
   Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.

   ^9And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.

   ^10And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and
   Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.

   ^11And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

   ^12And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and
   Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of
   Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.

   ^13And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.

   ^14And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.

   ^15These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram,
   with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters
   were thirty and three.

   ^16And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and
   Arodi, and Areli.

   ^17And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and
   Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.

   ^18These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter,
   and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.

   ^19The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.

   ^20And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim,
   which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.

   ^21And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera,
   and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.

   ^22These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the
   souls were fourteen.

   ^23And the sons of Dan; Hushim.

   ^24And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.

   ^25These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his
   daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.

   ^26All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his
   loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and
   six;

   ^27And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two
   souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were
   threescore and ten.

   ^28And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto
   Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.

   ^29And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his
   father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his
   neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

   ^30And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy
   face, because thou art yet alive.

   ^31And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I
   will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my
   father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;

   ^32And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle;
   and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they
   have.

   ^33And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall
   say, What is your occupation?

   ^34That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from
   our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may
   dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto
   the Egyptians.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 47

   Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren,
   and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out
   of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.

   ^2And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them
   unto Pharaoh.

   ^3And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they
   said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our
   fathers.

   ^4They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we
   come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine
   is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy
   servants dwell in the land of Goshen.

   ^5And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren
   are come unto thee:

   ^6The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy
   father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and
   if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers
   over my cattle.

   ^7And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh:
   and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

   ^8And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?

   ^9And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage
   are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the
   years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years
   of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.

   ^10And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.

   ^11And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a
   possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land
   of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

   ^12And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his
   father's household, with bread, according to their families.

   ^13And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very
   sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by
   reason of the famine.

   ^14And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of
   Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and
   Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.

   ^15And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of
   Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread:
   for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.

   ^16And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your
   cattle, if money fail.

   ^17And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them
   bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of
   the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their
   cattle for that year.

   ^18When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and
   said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is
   spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left
   in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:

   ^19Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy
   us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto
   Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land
   be not desolate.

   ^20And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the
   Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over
   them: so the land became Pharaoh's.

   ^21And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the
   borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.

   ^22Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a
   portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which
   Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.

   ^23Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day
   and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow
   the land.

   ^24And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the
   fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of
   the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for
   food for your little ones.

   ^25And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the
   sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.

   ^26And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that
   Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests
   only, which became not Pharaoh's.

   ^27And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and
   they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.

   ^28And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole
   age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.

   ^29And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son
   Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put,
   I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with
   me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:

   ^30But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of
   Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as
   thou hast said.

   ^31And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed
   himself upon the bed's head.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 48

   And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold,
   thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and
   Ephraim.

   ^2And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto
   thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.

   ^3And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in
   the land of Canaan, and blessed me,

   ^4And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply
   thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this
   land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.

   ^5And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee
   in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as
   Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.

   ^6And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and
   shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.

   ^7And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land
   of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto
   Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is
   Bethlehem.

   ^8And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?

   ^9And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath
   given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me,
   and I will bless them.

   ^10Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see.
   And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced
   them.

   ^11And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and,
   lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.

   ^12And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed
   himself with his face to the earth.

   ^13And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's
   left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand,
   and brought them near unto him.

   ^14And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's
   head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head,
   guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.

   ^15And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham
   and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this
   day,

   ^16The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let
   my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;
   and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.

   ^17And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the
   head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand,
   to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.

   ^18And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the
   firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.

   ^19And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he
   also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his
   younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a
   multitude of nations.

   ^20And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless,
   saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim
   before Manasseh.

   ^21And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with
   you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.

   ^22Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which
   I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 49

   And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together,
   that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.

   ^2Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken
   unto Israel your father.

   ^3Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my
   strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:

   ^4Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to
   thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.

   ^5Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their
   habitations.

   ^6O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine
   honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in
   their selfwill they digged down a wall.

   ^7Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was
   cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.

   ^8Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be
   in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down
   before thee.

   ^9Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he
   stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse
   him up?

   ^10The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between
   his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the
   people be.

   ^11Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice
   vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of
   grapes:

   ^12His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.

   ^13Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an
   haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.

   ^14Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:

   ^15And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant;
   and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.

   ^16Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

   ^17Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth
   the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.

   ^18I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord.

   ^19Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.

   ^20Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal
   dainties.

   ^21Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.

   ^22Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose
   branches run over the wall:

   ^23The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:

   ^24But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made
   strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the
   shepherd, the stone of Israel:)

   ^25Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the
   Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,
   blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and
   of the womb:

   ^26The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my
   progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall
   be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was
   separate from his brethren.

   ^27Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the
   prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.

   ^28All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their
   father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his
   blessing he blessed them.

   ^29And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my
   people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of
   Ephron the Hittite,

   ^30In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before
   Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of
   Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.

   ^31There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried
   Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.

   ^32The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from
   the children of Heth.

   ^33And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered
   up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered
   unto his people.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 50

   And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed
   him.

   ^2And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his
   father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.

   ^3And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days
   of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him
   threescore and ten days.

   ^4And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the
   house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,
   speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,

   ^5My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have
   digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now
   therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will
   come again.

   ^6And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made
   thee swear.

   ^7And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the
   servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the
   land of Egypt,

   ^8And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's
   house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they
   left in the land of Goshen.

   ^9And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a
   very great company.

   ^10And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan,
   and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he
   made a mourning for his father seven days.

   ^11And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the
   mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning
   to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim,
   which is beyond Jordan.

   ^12And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:

   ^13For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in
   the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field
   for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

   ^14And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that
   went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.

   ^15And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they
   said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us
   all the evil which we did unto him.

   ^16And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did
   command before he died, saying,

   ^17So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass
   of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now,
   we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy
   father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.

   ^18And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they
   said, Behold, we be thy servants.

   ^19And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?

   ^20But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto
   good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.

   ^21Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones.
   And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.

   ^22And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph
   lived an hundred and ten years.

   ^23And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the
   children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon
   Joseph's knees.

   ^24And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit
   you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to
   Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

   ^25And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will
   surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.

   ^26So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they
   embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

  The Second Book of Moses, Called

Exodus
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 1

   Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into
   Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.

   ^2Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

   ^3Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

   ^4Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

   ^5And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy
   souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.

   ^6And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.

   ^7And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly,
   and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled
   with them.

   ^8Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.

   ^9And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of
   Israel are more and mightier than we:

   ^10Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it
   come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto
   our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.

   ^11Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with
   their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and
   Raamses.

   ^12But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.
   And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.

   ^13And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:

   ^14And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and
   in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service,
   wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.

   ^15And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the
   name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:

   ^16And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women,
   and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him:
   but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.

   ^17But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt
   commanded them, but saved the men children alive.

   ^18And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them,
   Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?

   ^19And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not
   as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the
   midwives come in unto them.

   ^20Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people
   multiplied, and waxed very mighty.

   ^21And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made
   them houses.

   ^22And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born
   ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 2

   And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter
   of Levi.

   ^2And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he
   was a goodly child, she hid him three months.

   ^3And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of
   bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child
   therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.

   ^4And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.

   ^5And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river;
   and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the
   ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.

   ^6And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe
   wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the
   Hebrews' children.

   ^7Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to
   thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for
   thee?

   ^8And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called
   the child's mother.

   ^9And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse
   it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the
   child, and nursed it.

   ^10And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and
   he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because
   I drew him out of the water.

   ^11And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he
   went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied
   an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.

   ^12And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was
   no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.

   ^13And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews
   strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore
   smitest thou thy fellow?

   ^14And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest
   thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and
   said, Surely this thing is known.

   ^15Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But
   Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:
   and he sat down by a well.

   ^16Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew
   water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.

   ^17And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and
   helped them, and watered their flock.

   ^18And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye
   are come so soon to day?

   ^19And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the
   shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.

   ^20And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye
   have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

   ^21And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses
   Zipporah his daughter.

   ^22And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said,
   I have been a stranger in a strange land.

   ^23And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died:
   and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they
   cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.

   ^24And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with
   Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

   ^25And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto
   them.

    Chapter 3

   Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of
   Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to
   the mountain of God, even to Horeb.

   ^2And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of
   the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with
   fire, and the bush was not consumed.

   ^3And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why
   the bush is not burnt.

   ^4And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto
   him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said,
   Here am I.

   ^5And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy
   feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

   ^6Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the
   God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was
   afraid to look upon God.

   ^7And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people
   which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their
   taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;

   ^8And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians,
   and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large,
   unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the
   Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and
   the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

   ^9Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto
   me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress
   them.

   ^10Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou
   mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.

   ^11And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,
   and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?

   ^12And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a
   token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth
   the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

   ^13And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of
   Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me
   unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say
   unto them?

   ^14And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt
   thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.

   ^15And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the
   children of Israel, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,
   the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is
   my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.

   ^16Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The
   Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob,
   appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that
   which is done to you in Egypt:

   ^17And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt
   unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites,
   and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land
   flowing with milk and honey.

   ^18And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and
   the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto
   him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go,
   we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may
   sacrifice to the Lord our God.

   ^19And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by
   a mighty hand.

   ^20And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders
   which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you
   go.

   ^21And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:
   and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:

   ^22But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that
   sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and
   raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters;
   and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

    Chapter 4

   And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor
   hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared
   unto thee.

   ^2And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said,
   A rod.

   ^3And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and
   it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.

   ^4And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by
   the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod
   in his hand:

   ^5That they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of
   Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto
   thee.

   ^6And the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy
   bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out,
   behold, his hand was leprous as snow.

   ^7And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand
   into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it
   was turned again as his other flesh.

   ^8And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither
   hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the
   voice of the latter sign.

   ^9And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two
   signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the
   water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which
   thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.

   ^10And Moses said unto the Lord, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither
   heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow
   of speech, and of a slow tongue.

   ^11And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh
   the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the Lord?

   ^12Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what
   thou shalt say.

   ^13And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom
   thou wilt send.

   ^14And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is
   not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And
   also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he
   will be glad in his heart.

   ^15And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I
   will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye
   shall do.

   ^16And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even
   he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him
   instead of God.

   ^17And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do
   signs.

   ^18And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said
   unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are
   in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses,
   Go in peace.

   ^19And the Lord said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for
   all the men are dead which sought thy life.

   ^20And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and
   he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his
   hand.

   ^21And the Lord said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt,
   see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in
   thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the
   people go.

   ^22And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my
   son, even my firstborn:

   ^23And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if
   thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy
   firstborn.

   ^24And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the Lord met him,
   and sought to kill him.

   ^25Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her
   son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art
   thou to me.

   ^26So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because
   of the circumcision.

   ^27And the Lord said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.
   And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.

   ^28And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him, and
   all the signs which he had commanded him.

   ^29And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the
   children of Israel:

   ^30And Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses,
   and did the signs in the sight of the people.

   ^31And the people believed: and when they heard that the Lord had
   visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their
   affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

    Chapter 5

   And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the
   Lord God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto
   me in the wilderness.

   ^2And Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice to
   let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.

   ^3And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we
   pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the
   Lord our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.

   ^4And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and
   Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.

   ^5And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye
   make them rest from their burdens.

   ^6And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and
   their officers, saying,

   ^7Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore:
   let them go and gather straw for themselves.

   ^8And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall
   lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle;
   therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.

   ^9Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
   therein; and let them not regard vain words.

   ^10And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and
   they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give
   you straw.

   ^11Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your
   work shall be diminished.

   ^12So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt
   to gather stubble instead of straw.

   ^13And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your
   daily tasks, as when there was straw.

   ^14And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's
   taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore
   have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to
   day, as heretofore?

   ^15Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto
   Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?

   ^16There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make
   brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine
   own people.

   ^17But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go
   and do sacrifice to the Lord.

   ^18Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you,
   yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.

   ^19And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in
   evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your
   bricks of your daily task.

   ^20And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came
   forth from Pharaoh:

   ^21And they said unto them, The Lord look upon you, and judge; because
   ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in
   the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.

   ^22And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Lord, wherefore hast
   thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?

   ^23For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil
   to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

    Chapter 6

   Then the Lord said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to
   Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong
   hand shall he drive them out of his land.

   ^2And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord:

   ^3And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name
   of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.

   ^4And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the
   land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were
   strangers.

   ^5And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom
   the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.

   ^6Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the Lord, and I will
   bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid
   you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out
   arm, and with great judgments:

   ^7And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God:
   and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you out
   from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

   ^8And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did
   swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it
   you for an heritage: I am the Lord.

   ^9And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened
   not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.

   ^10And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^11Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of
   Israel go out of his land.

   ^12And Moses spake before the Lord, saying, Behold, the children of
   Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who
   am of uncircumcised lips?

   ^13And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge
   unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring
   the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

   ^14These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the
   firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the
   families of Reuben.

   ^15And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and
   Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families
   of Simeon.

   ^16And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their
   generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life
   of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.

   ^17The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.

   ^18And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel:
   and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three
   years.

   ^19And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of
   Levi according to their generations.

   ^20And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she
   bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an
   hundred and thirty and seven years.

   ^21And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

   ^22And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.

   ^23And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of
   Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and
   Ithamar.

   ^24And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are
   the families of the Korhites.

   ^25And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to
   wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of
   the Levites according to their families.

   ^26These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the Lord said, Bring out the
   children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.

   ^27These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out
   the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.

   ^28And it came to pass on the day when the Lord spake unto Moses in the
   land of Egypt,

   ^29That the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, I am the Lord: speak thou
   unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.

   ^30And Moses said before the Lord, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips,
   and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 7

   And the Lord said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh:
   and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.

   ^2Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall
   speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his
   land.

   ^3And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my
   wonders in the land of Egypt.

   ^4But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon
   Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of
   Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.

   ^5And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I stretch forth
   mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among
   them.

   ^6And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them, so did they.

   ^7And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three
   years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.

   ^8And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

   ^9When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you:
   then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before
   Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.

   ^10And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the
   Lord had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and
   before his servants, and it became a serpent.

   ^11Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the
   magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their
   enchantments.

   ^12For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but
   Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

   ^13And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as
   the Lord had said.

   ^14And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he
   refuseth to let the people go.

   ^15Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the
   water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and
   the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.

   ^16And thou shalt say unto him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath sent
   me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the
   wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.

   ^17Thus saith the Lord, In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord:
   behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters
   which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.

   ^18And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall
   stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the
   river.

   ^19And the Lord spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and
   stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams,
   upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of
   water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood
   throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in
   vessels of stone.

   ^20And Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded; and he lifted up
   the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of
   Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were
   in the river were turned to blood.

   ^21And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and
   the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was
   blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

   ^22And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and
   Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the
   Lord had said.

   ^23And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his
   heart to this also.

   ^24And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to
   drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.

   ^25And seven days were fulfilled, after that the Lord had smitten the
   river.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 8

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus
   saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

   ^2And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy
   borders with frogs:

   ^3And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up
   and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed,
   and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine
   ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:

   ^4And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and
   upon all thy servants.

   ^5And the Lord spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine
   hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the
   ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.

   ^6And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the
   frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.

   ^7And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up
   frogs upon the land of Egypt.

   ^8Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the Lord,
   that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will
   let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the Lord.

   ^9And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for
   thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs
   from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?

   ^10And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word:
   that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the Lord our God.

   ^11And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from
   thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.

   ^12And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the
   Lord because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.

   ^13And the Lord did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died
   out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.

   ^14And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.

   ^15But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart,
   and hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had said.

   ^16And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod,
   and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all
   the land of Egypt.

   ^17And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and
   smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast;
   all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

   ^18And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth
   lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.

   ^19Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and
   Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the
   Lord had said.

   ^20And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and
   stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto
   him, Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

   ^21Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms
   of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and
   into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of
   swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.

   ^22And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people
   dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest
   know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth.

   ^23And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to
   morrow shall this sign be.

   ^24And the Lord did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into
   the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the
   land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.

   ^25And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,
   sacrifice to your God in the land.

   ^26And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the
   abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord our God: lo, shall we
   sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will
   they not stone us?

   ^27We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to
   the Lord our God, as he shall command us.

   ^28And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the
   Lord your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away:
   intreat for me.

   ^29And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the
   Lord that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his
   servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal
   deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the
   Lord.

   ^30And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the Lord.

   ^31And the Lord did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the
   swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people;
   there remained not one.

   ^32And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he
   let the people go.

    Chapter 9

   Then the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus
   saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may
   serve me.

   ^2For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,

   ^3Behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thy cattle which is in the
   field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen,
   and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.

   ^4And the Lord shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle
   of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of
   Israel.

   ^5And the Lord appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the Lord shall
   do this thing in the land.

   ^6And the Lord did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of
   Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.

   ^7And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the
   Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not
   let the people go.

   ^8And the Lord said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of
   ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in
   the sight of Pharaoh.

   ^9And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be
   a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout
   all the land of Egypt.

   ^10And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and
   Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking
   forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.

   ^11And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils;
   for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.

   ^12And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not
   unto them; as the Lord had spoken unto Moses.

   ^13And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and
   stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of the
   Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

   ^14For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and
   upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that
   there is none like me in all the earth.

   ^15For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy
   people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.

   ^16And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew
   in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the
   earth.

   ^17As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not
   let them go?

   ^18Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very
   grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation
   thereof even until now.

   ^19Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in
   the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the
   field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon
   them, and they shall die.

   ^20He that feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh
   made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:

   ^21And he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and
   his cattle in the field.

   ^22And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward
   heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and
   upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of
   Egypt.

   ^23And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the Lord sent
   thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the Lord
   rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

   ^24So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,
   such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became
   a nation.

   ^25And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in
   the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the
   field, and brake every tree of the field.

   ^26Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was
   there no hail.

   ^27And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto
   them, I have sinned this time: the Lord is righteous, and I and my
   people are wicked.

   ^28Intreat the Lord (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty
   thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no
   longer.

   ^29And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I
   will spread abroad my hands unto the Lord; and the thunder shall cease,
   neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that
   the earth is the Lord'S.

   ^30But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear
   the Lord God.

   ^31And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the
   ear, and the flax was bolled.

   ^32But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown
   up.

   ^33And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his
   hands unto the Lord: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was
   not poured upon the earth.

   ^34And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders
   were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his
   servants.

   ^35And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the
   children of Israel go; as the Lord had spoken by Moses.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 10

   And the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened
   his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my
   signs before him:

   ^2And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's
   son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have
   done among them; that ye may know how that I am the Lord.

   ^3And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus
   saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble
   thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.

   ^4Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I
   bring the locusts into thy coast:

   ^5And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able
   to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is
   escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every
   tree which groweth for you out of the field:

   ^6And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants,
   and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy
   fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth
   unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.

   ^7And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a
   snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the Lord their God:
   knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?

   ^8And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto
   them, Go, serve the Lord your God: but who are they that shall go?

   ^9And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our
   sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we
   go; for we must hold a feast unto the Lord.

   ^10And he said unto them, Let the Lord be so with you, as I will let
   you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.

   ^11Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the Lord; for that ye did
   desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.

   ^12And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land
   of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt,
   and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.

   ^13And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the
   Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that
   night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.

   ^14And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in
   all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there
   were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.

   ^15For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was
   darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of
   the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green
   thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land
   of Egypt.

   ^16Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I
   have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you.

   ^17Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and
   intreat the Lord your God, that he may take away from me this death
   only.

   ^18And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the Lord.

   ^19And the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the
   locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust
   in all the coasts of Egypt.

   ^20But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the
   children of Israel go.

   ^21And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven,
   that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which
   may be felt.

   ^22And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a
   thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:

   ^23They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three
   days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.

   ^24And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the Lord; only
   let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go
   with you.

   ^25And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt
   offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God.

   ^26Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left
   behind; for thereof must we take to serve the Lord our God; and we know
   not with what we must serve the Lord, until we come thither.

   ^27But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.

   ^28And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself,
   see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.

   ^29And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no
   more.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 11

   And the Lord said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon
   Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he
   shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.

   ^2Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his
   neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and
   jewels of gold.

   ^3And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians.
   Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the
   sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.

   ^4And Moses said, Thus saith the Lord, About midnight will I go out
   into the midst of Egypt:

   ^5And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the
   firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the
   firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the
   firstborn of beasts.

   ^6And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such
   as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.

   ^7But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his
   tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the Lord doth
   put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.

   ^8And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down
   themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that
   follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh
   in a great anger.

   ^9And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;
   that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

   ^10And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the
   Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of
   Israel go out of his land.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 12

   And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,

   ^2This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the
   first month of the year to you.

   ^3Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth
   day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according
   to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:

   ^4And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his
   neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the
   souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the
   lamb.

   ^5Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye
   shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:

   ^6And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month:
   and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in
   the evening.

   ^7And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts
   and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.

   ^8And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and
   unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

   ^9Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire;
   his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.

   ^10And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that
   which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.

   ^11And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your
   feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is
   the Lord'S passover.

   ^12For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite
   all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against
   all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord.

   ^13And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye
   are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague
   shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.

   ^14And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it
   a feast to the Lord throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a
   feast by an ordinance for ever.

   ^15Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye
   shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened
   bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut
   off from Israel.

   ^16And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the
   seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of
   work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that
   only may be done of you.

   ^17And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this
   selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:
   therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance
   for ever.

   ^18In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye
   shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the
   month at even.

   ^19Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for
   whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut
   off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born
   in the land.

   ^20Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat
   unleavened bread.

   ^21Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them,
   Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the
   passover.

   ^22And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is
   in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the
   blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of
   his house until the morning.

   ^23For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he
   seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the Lord
   will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in
   unto your houses to smite you.

   ^24And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy
   sons for ever.

   ^25And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the
   Lord will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep
   this service.

   ^26And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you,
   What mean ye by this service?

   ^27That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord'S passover, who
   passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he
   smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the
   head and worshipped.

   ^28And the children of Israel went away, and did as the Lord had
   commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

   ^29And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the
   firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat
   on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the
   dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.

   ^30And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all
   the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a
   house where there was not one dead.

   ^31And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and
   get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel;
   and go, serve the Lord, as ye have said.

   ^32Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone;
   and bless me also.

   ^33And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send
   them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.

   ^34And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their
   kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.

   ^35And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and
   they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
   and raiment:

   ^36And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians,
   so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they
   spoiled the Egyptians.

   ^37And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about
   six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.

   ^38And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds,
   even very much cattle.

   ^39And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought
   forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust
   out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for
   themselves any victual.

   ^40Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt,
   was four hundred and thirty years.

   ^41And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years,
   even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord
   went out from the land of Egypt.

   ^42It is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them
   out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the Lord to be
   observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.

   ^43And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the
   passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:

   ^44But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast
   circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.

   ^45A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.

   ^46In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of
   the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone
   thereof.

   ^47All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

   ^48And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the
   passover to the Lord, let all his males be circumcised, and then let
   him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the
   land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.

   ^49One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that
   sojourneth among you.

   ^50Thus did all the children of Israel; as the Lord commanded Moses and
   Aaron, so did they.

   ^51And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the Lord did bring the
   children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 13

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among
   the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.

   ^3And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came
   out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand
   the Lord brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread
   be eaten.

   ^4This day came ye out in the month Abib.

   ^5And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the
   Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and
   the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land
   flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this
   month.

   ^6Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day
   shall be a feast to the Lord.

   ^7Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no
   leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen
   with thee in all thy quarters.

   ^8And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because
   of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.

   ^9And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a
   memorial between thine eyes, that the Lord'S law may be in thy mouth:
   for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt.

   ^10Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to
   year.

   ^11And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the
   Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it
   thee,

   ^12That thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix,
   and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males
   shall be the Lord'S.

   ^13And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if
   thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the
   firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.

   ^14And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying,
   What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the
   Lord brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:

   ^15And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the
   Lord slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of
   man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all
   that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my
   children I redeem.

   ^16And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets
   between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth
   out of Egypt.

   ^17And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God
   led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although
   that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when
   they see war, and they return to Egypt:

   ^18But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of
   the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the
   land of Egypt.

   ^19And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly
   sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye
   shall carry up my bones away hence with you.

   ^20And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in
   the edge of the wilderness.

   ^21And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead
   them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to
   go by day and night:

   ^22He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of
   fire by night, from before the people.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 14

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before
   Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before
   it shall ye encamp by the sea.

   ^3For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in
   the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.

   ^4And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them;
   and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the
   Egyptians may know that I am the Lord. And they did so.

   ^5And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart
   of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they
   said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving
   us?

   ^6And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:

   ^7And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of
   Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

   ^8And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he
   pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went
   out with an high hand.

   ^9But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of
   Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by
   the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.

   ^10And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their
   eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore
   afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord.

   ^11And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,
   hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou
   dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?

   ^12Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us
   alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us
   to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.

   ^13And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see
   the salvation of the Lord, which he will shew to you to day: for the
   Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for
   ever.

   ^14The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

   ^15And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak
   unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:

   ^16But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea,
   and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground
   through the midst of the sea.

   ^17And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they
   shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all
   his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

   ^18And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I have gotten
   me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

   ^19And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed
   and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before
   their face, and stood behind them:

   ^20And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of
   Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by
   night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.

   ^21And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused
   the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the
   sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

   ^22And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the
   dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand,
   and on their left.

   ^23And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of
   the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.

   ^24And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto
   the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud,
   and troubled the host of the Egyptians,

   ^25And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so
   that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the
   Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians.

   ^26And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea,
   that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots,
   and upon their horsemen.

   ^27And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
   returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians
   fled against it; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of
   the sea.

   ^28And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen,
   and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there
   remained not so much as one of them.

   ^29But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the
   sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on
   their left.

   ^30Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the
   Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.

   ^31And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the
   Egyptians: and the people feared the Lord, and believed the Lord, and
   his servant Moses.

    Chapter 15

   Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and
   spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed
   gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

   ^2The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he
   is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I
   will exalt him.

   ^3The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name.

   ^4Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen
   captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

   ^5The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.

   ^6Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power: thy right hand,
   O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

   ^7And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them
   that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed
   them as stubble.

   ^8And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together,
   the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in
   the heart of the sea.

   ^9The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the
   spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my
   hand shall destroy them.

   ^10Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as
   lead in the mighty waters.

   ^11Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee,
   glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

   ^12Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

   ^13Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
   redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy
   habitation.

   ^14The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the
   inhabitants of Palestina.

   ^15Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,
   trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan
   shall melt away.

   ^16Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm
   they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O Lord,
   till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.

   ^17Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine
   inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to
   dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.

   ^18The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.

   ^19For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his
   horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea
   upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of
   the sea.

   ^20And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in
   her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with
   dances.

   ^21And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed
   gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

   ^22So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the
   wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and
   found no water.

   ^23And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of
   Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.

   ^24And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?

   ^25And he cried unto the Lord; and the Lord shewed him a tree, which
   when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he
   made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,

   ^26And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord
   thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give
   ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of
   these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for
   I am the Lord that healeth thee.

   ^27And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and
   threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 16

   And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the
   children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between
   Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their
   departing out of the land of Egypt.

   ^2And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against
   Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:

   ^3And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died
   by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh
   pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us
   forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

   ^4Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven
   for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every
   day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.

   ^5And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare
   that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather
   daily.

   ^6And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even,
   then ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of
   Egypt:

   ^7And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the Lord; for that
   he heareth your murmurings against the Lord: and what are we, that ye
   murmur against us?

   ^8And Moses said, This shall be, when the Lord shall give you in the
   evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that
   the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what
   are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord.

   ^9And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the
   children of Israel, Come near before the Lord: for he hath heard your
   murmurings.

   ^10And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of
   the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and,
   behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.

   ^11And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^12I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto
   them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall
   be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.

   ^13And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered
   the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.

   ^14And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the
   wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on
   the ground.

   ^15And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It
   is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This
   is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.

   ^16This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, Gather of it every
   man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the
   number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his
   tents.

   ^17And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some
   less.

   ^18And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had
   nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered
   every man according to his eating.

   ^19And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

   ^20Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left
   of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was
   wroth with them.

   ^21And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his
   eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

   ^22And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as
   much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the
   congregation came and told Moses.

   ^23And he said unto them, This is that which the Lord hath said, To
   morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the Lord: bake that which
   ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which
   remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.

   ^24And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not
   stink, neither was there any worm therein.

   ^25And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the
   Lord: to day ye shall not find it in the field.

   ^26Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the
   sabbath, in it there shall be none.

   ^27And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the
   seventh day for to gather, and they found none.

   ^28And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my
   commandments and my laws?

   ^29See, for that the Lord hath given you the sabbath, therefore he
   giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man
   in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.

   ^30So the people rested on the seventh day.

   ^31And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was
   like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made
   with honey.

   ^32And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commandeth, Fill an
   omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread
   wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth
   from the land of Egypt.

   ^33And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna
   therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your
   generations.

   ^34As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the
   Testimony, to be kept.

   ^35And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they
   came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the
   borders of the land of Canaan.

   ^36Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 17

   And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the
   wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment
   of the Lord, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the
   people to drink.

   ^2Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water
   that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me?
   wherefore do ye tempt the Lord?

   ^3And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured
   against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up
   out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?

   ^4And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, What shall I do unto this
   people? they be almost ready to stone me.

   ^5And the Lord said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with
   thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the
   river, take in thine hand, and go.

   ^6Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and
   thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that
   the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of
   Israel.

   ^7And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of
   the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the
   Lord, saying, Is the Lord among us, or not?

   ^8Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

   ^9And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with
   Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of
   God in mine hand.

   ^10So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and
   Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.

   ^11And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
   prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

   ^12But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under
   him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one
   on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were
   steady until the going down of the sun.

   ^13And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the
   sword.

   ^14And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book,
   and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the
   remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

   ^15And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:

   ^16For he said, Because the Lord hath sworn that the Lord will have war
   with Amalek from generation to generation.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 18

   When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all
   that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the
   Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt;

   ^2Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after
   he had sent her back,

   ^3And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he
   said, I have been an alien in a strange land:

   ^4And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said
   he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:

   ^5And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife
   unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:

   ^6And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee,
   and thy wife, and her two sons with her.

   ^7And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and
   kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came
   into the tent.

   ^8And Moses told his father in law all that the Lord had done unto
   Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail
   that had come upon them by the way, and how the Lord delivered them.

   ^9And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the Lord had done to
   Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.

   ^10And Jethro said, Blessed be the Lord, who hath delivered you out of
   the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath
   delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

   ^11Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods: for in the thing
   wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.

   ^12And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and
   sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to
   eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.

   ^13And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the
   people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the
   evening.

   ^14And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he
   said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest
   thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto
   even?

   ^15And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto
   me to enquire of God:

   ^16When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one
   and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.

   ^17And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is
   not good.

   ^18Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with
   thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to
   perform it thyself alone.

   ^19Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall
   be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest
   bring the causes unto God:

   ^20And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them
   the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.

   ^21Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as
   fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them,
   to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties,
   and rulers of tens:

   ^22And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that
   every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter
   they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall
   bear the burden with thee.

   ^23If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou
   shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their
   place in peace.

   ^24So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all
   that he had said.

   ^25And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over
   the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties,
   and rulers of tens.

   ^26And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they
   brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.

   ^27And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his
   own land.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 19

   In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of
   the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.

   ^2For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of
   Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped
   before the mount.

   ^3And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the
   mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell
   the children of Israel;

   ^4Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on
   eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.

   ^5Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant,
   then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all
   the earth is mine:

   ^6And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.
   These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.

   ^7And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid
   before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded him.

   ^8And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord
   hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto
   the Lord.

   ^9And the Lord said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud,
   that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for
   ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord.

   ^10And the Lord said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them
   to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,

   ^11And be ready against the third day: for the third day the Lord will
   come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.

   ^12And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take
   heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the
   border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to
   death:

   ^13There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or
   shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the
   trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.

   ^14And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified
   the people; and they washed their clothes.

   ^15And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come
   not at your wives.

   ^16And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were
   thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the
   voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in
   the camp trembled.

   ^17And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God;
   and they stood at the nether part of the mount.

   ^18And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord
   descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke
   of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

   ^19And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and
   louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.

   ^20And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount:
   and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went
   up.

   ^21And the Lord said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they
   break through unto the Lord to gaze, and many of them perish.

   ^22And let the priests also, which come near to the Lord, sanctify
   themselves, lest the Lord break forth upon them.

   ^23And Moses said unto the Lord, The people cannot come up to mount
   Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and
   sanctify it.

   ^24And the Lord said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come
   up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people
   break through to come up unto the Lord, lest he break forth upon them.

   ^25So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 20

   And God spake all these words, saying,

   ^2I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of
   Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

   ^3Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

   ^4Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of
   any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or
   that is in the water under the earth:

   ^5Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the
   Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
   upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that
   hate me;

   ^6And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my
   commandments.

   ^7Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the
   Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

   ^8Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

   ^9Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

   ^10But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou
   shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy
   manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that
   is within thy gates:

   ^11For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
   that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed
   the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

   ^12Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the
   land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

   ^13Thou shalt not kill.

   ^14Thou shalt not commit adultery.

   ^15Thou shalt not steal.

   ^16Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

   ^17Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy
   neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox,
   nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

   ^18And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the
   noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw
   it, they removed, and stood afar off.

   ^19And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but
   let not God speak with us, lest we die.

   ^20And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove
   you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.

   ^21And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick
   darkness where God was.

   ^22And the Lord said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children
   of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.

   ^23Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto
   you gods of gold.

   ^24An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
   thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and
   thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee,
   and I will bless thee.

   ^25And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it
   of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted
   it.

   ^26Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy
   nakedness be not discovered thereon.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 21

   Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.

   ^2If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the
   seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

   ^3If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were
   married, then his wife shall go out with him.

   ^4If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or
   daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he
   shall go out by himself.

   ^5And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and
   my children; I will not go out free:

   ^6Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring
   him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his
   ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.

   ^7And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go
   out as the menservants do.

   ^8If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then
   shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he
   shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.

   ^9And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her
   after the manner of daughters.

   ^10If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of
   marriage, shall he not diminish.

   ^11And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free
   without money.

   ^12He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.

   ^13And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand;
   then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.

   ^14But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him
   with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.

   ^15And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put
   to death.

   ^16And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in
   his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

   ^17And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put
   to death.

   ^18And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or
   with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:

   ^19If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that
   smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and
   shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.

   ^20And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die
   under his hand; he shall be surely punished.

   ^21Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be
   punished: for he is his money.

   ^22If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart
   from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished,
   according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as
   the judges determine.

   ^23And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,

   ^24Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

   ^25Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

   ^26And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid,
   that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.

   ^27And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's
   tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.

   ^28If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be
   surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the
   ox shall be quit.

   ^29But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it
   hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that
   he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner
   also shall be put to death.

   ^30If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the
   ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.

   ^31Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to
   this judgment shall it be done unto him.

   ^32If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give
   unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.

   ^33And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not
   cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;

   ^34The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the
   owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.

   ^35And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall
   sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they
   shall divide.

   ^36Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and
   his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the
   dead shall be his own.

    Chapter 22

   If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he
   shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.

   ^2If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there
   shall no blood be shed for him.

   ^3If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for
   he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be
   sold for his theft.

   ^4If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox,
   or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.

   ^5If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put
   in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his
   own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make
   restitution.

   ^6If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn,
   or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that
   kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.

   ^7If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and
   it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay
   double.

   ^8If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be
   brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his
   neighbour's goods.

   ^9For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep,
   for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, which another challengeth
   to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and
   whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.

   ^10If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or
   any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man
   seeing it:

   ^11Then shall an oath of the Lord be between them both, that he hath
   not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall
   accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.

   ^12And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the
   owner thereof.

   ^13If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he
   shall not make good that which was torn.

   ^14And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die,
   the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good.

   ^15But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if
   it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.

   ^16And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her,
   he shall surely endow her to be his wife.

   ^17If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay
   money according to the dowry of virgins.

   ^18Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

   ^19Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.

   ^20He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall
   be utterly destroyed.

   ^21Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were
   strangers in the land of Egypt.

   ^22Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.

   ^23If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I
   will surely hear their cry;

   ^24And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and
   your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.

   ^25If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou
   shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him
   usury.

   ^26If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt
   deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:

   ^27For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin:
   wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto
   me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.

   ^28Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.

   ^29Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of
   thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.

   ^30Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven
   days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.

   ^31And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh
   that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.

    Chapter 23

   Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked
   to be an unrighteous witness.

   ^2Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou
   speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:

   ^3Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.

   ^4If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt
   surely bring it back to him again.

   ^5If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden,
   and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.

   ^6Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.

   ^7Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous
   slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.

   ^8And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and
   perverteth the words of the righteous.

   ^9Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a
   stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

   ^10And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the
   fruits thereof:

   ^11But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the
   poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field
   shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with
   thy oliveyard.

   ^12Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt
   rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy
   handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

   ^13And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make
   no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of
   thy mouth.

   ^14Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.

   ^15Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat
   unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed
   of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall
   appear before me empty:)

   ^16And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou
   hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the
   end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the
   field.

   ^17Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord
   GOD.

   ^18Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread;
   neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.

   ^19The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the
   house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's
   milk.

   ^20Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to
   bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

   ^21Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not
   pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.

   ^22But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak;
   then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine
   adversaries.

   ^23For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the
   Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the
   Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.

   ^24Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after
   their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break
   down their images.

   ^25And ye shall serve the Lord your God, and he shall bless thy bread,
   and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.

   ^26There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land:
   the number of thy days I will fulfil.

   ^27I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to
   whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their
   backs unto thee.

   ^28And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the
   Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.

   ^29I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the
   land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.

   ^30By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until
   thou be increased, and inherit the land.

   ^31And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the
   Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the
   inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out
   before thee.

   ^32Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

   ^33They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against
   me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.

    Chapter 24

   And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the Lord, thou, and Aaron, Nadab,
   and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar
   off.

   ^2And Moses alone shall come near the Lord: but they shall not come
   nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.

   ^3And Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord, and all
   the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said,
   All the words which the Lord hath said will we do.

   ^4And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord, and rose up early in the
   morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars,
   according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

   ^5And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt
   offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the Lord.

   ^6And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half of
   the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

   ^7And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the
   people: and they said, All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be
   obedient.

   ^8And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said,
   Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with you
   concerning all these words.

   ^9Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the
   elders of Israel:

   ^10And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it
   were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of
   heaven in his clearness.

   ^11And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand:
   also they saw God, and did eat and drink.

   ^12And the Lord said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be
   there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and
   commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.

   ^13And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into
   the mount of God.

   ^14And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come
   again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man
   have any matters to do, let him come unto them.

   ^15And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.

   ^16And the glory of the Lord abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud
   covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of
   the midst of the cloud.

   ^17And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on
   the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.

   ^18And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the
   mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.

    Chapter 25

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of
   every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my
   offering.

   ^3And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and
   silver, and brass,

   ^4And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,

   ^5And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,

   ^6Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense,

   ^7Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the
   breastplate.

   ^8And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.

   ^9According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the
   tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so
   shall ye make it.

   ^10And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half
   shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth
   thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

   ^11And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt
   thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.

   ^12And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the
   four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and
   two rings in the other side of it.

   ^13And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with
   gold.

   ^14And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the
   ark, that the ark may be borne with them.

   ^15The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken
   from it.

   ^16And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give
   thee.

   ^17And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half
   shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth
   thereof.

   ^18And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou
   make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.

   ^19And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the
   other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the
   two ends thereof.

   ^20And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering
   the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to
   another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.

   ^21And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark
   thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.

   ^22And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from
   above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the
   ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in
   commandment unto the children of Israel.

   ^23Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be
   the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a
   half the height thereof.

   ^24And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown
   of gold round about.

   ^25And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about,
   and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.

   ^26And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in
   the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.

   ^27Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves
   to bear the table.

   ^28And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them
   with gold, that the table may be borne with them.

   ^29And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and
   covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of pure gold shalt
   thou make them.

   ^30And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.

   ^31And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall
   the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his
   knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.

   ^32And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches
   of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the
   candlestick out of the other side:

   ^33Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one
   branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a
   knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the
   candlestick.

   ^34And in the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds,
   with their knops and their flowers.

   ^35And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop
   under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the
   same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the
   candlestick.

   ^36Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be
   one beaten work of pure gold.

   ^37And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light
   the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.

   ^38And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure
   gold.

   ^39Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels.

   ^40And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed
   thee in the mount.

    Chapter 26

   Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine
   twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of
   cunning work shalt thou make them.

   ^2The length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits, and the
   breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of the curtains shall
   have one measure.

   ^3The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another; and other
   five curtains shall be coupled one to another.

   ^4And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain
   from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt thou make in the
   uttermost edge of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.

   ^5Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty loops shalt
   thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in the coupling of the
   second; that the loops may take hold one of another.

   ^6And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the curtains
   together with the taches: and it shall be one tabernacle.

   ^7And thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering upon the
   tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make.

   ^8The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth of
   one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains shall be all of one
   measure.

   ^9And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains
   by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of
   the tabernacle.

   ^10And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that
   is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain
   which coupleth the second.

   ^11And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches into
   the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one.

   ^12And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half
   curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle.

   ^13And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of that
   which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent, it shall
   hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to
   cover it.

   ^14And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red,
   and a covering above of badgers' skins.

   ^15And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood
   standing up.

   ^16Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half
   shall be the breadth of one board.

   ^17Two tenons shall there be in one board, set in order one against
   another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

   ^18And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on
   the south side southward.

   ^19And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards;
   two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under
   another board for his two tenons.

   ^20And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side there
   shall be twenty boards:

   ^21And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and
   two sockets under another board.

   ^22And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six
   boards.

   ^23And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in
   the two sides.

   ^24And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be
   coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus shall it be
   for them both; they shall be for the two corners.

   ^25And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen
   sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another
   board.

   ^26And thou shalt make bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the
   one side of the tabernacle,

   ^27And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle,
   and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the two
   sides westward.

   ^28And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end
   to end.

   ^29And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of
   gold for places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay the bars with
   gold.

   ^30And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion
   thereof which was shewed thee in the mount.

   ^31And thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and
   fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it be made:

   ^32And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood overlaid
   with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the four sockets of
   silver.

   ^33And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou mayest
   bring in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony: and the vail
   shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy.

   ^34And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the testimony in
   the most holy place.

   ^35And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the candlestick
   over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south:
   and thou shalt put the table on the north side.

   ^36And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue,
   and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with
   needlework.

   ^37And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of shittim wood,
   and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of gold: and thou
   shalt cast five sockets of brass for them.

    Chapter 27

   And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits long, and
   five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare: and the height
   thereof shall be three cubits.

   ^2And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners thereof:
   his horns shall be of the same: and thou shalt overlay it with brass.

   ^3And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes, and his shovels,
   and his basons, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans: all the vessels
   thereof thou shalt make of brass.

   ^4And thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass; and upon the
   net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four corners thereof.

   ^5And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath, that
   the net may be even to the midst of the altar.

   ^6And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim wood, and
   overlay them with brass.

   ^7And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves shall be
   upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it.

   ^8Hollow with boards shalt thou make it: as it was shewed thee in the
   mount, so shall they make it.

   ^9And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the south side
   southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined linen of
   an hundred cubits long for one side:

   ^10And the twenty pillars thereof and their twenty sockets shall be of
   brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall be of silver.

   ^11And likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings of
   an hundred cubits long, and his twenty pillars and their twenty sockets
   of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.

   ^12And for the breadth of the court on the west side shall be hangings
   of fifty cubits: their pillars ten, and their sockets ten.

   ^13And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall be
   fifty cubits.

   ^14The hangings of one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits: their
   pillars three, and their sockets three.

   ^15And on the other side shall be hangings fifteen cubits: their
   pillars three, and their sockets three.

   ^16And for the gate of the court shall be an hanging of twenty cubits,
   of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with
   needlework: and their pillars shall be four, and their sockets four.

   ^17All the pillars round about the court shall be filleted with silver;
   their hooks shall be of silver, and their sockets of brass.

   ^18The length of the court shall be an hundred cubits, and the breadth
   fifty every where, and the height five cubits of fine twined linen, and
   their sockets of brass.

   ^19All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and
   all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass.

   ^20And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring thee
   pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn always.

   ^21In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail, which is
   before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it from evening to
   morning before the Lord: it shall be a statute for ever unto their
   generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.

    Chapter 28

   And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from
   among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in the
   priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar,
   Aaron's sons.

   ^2And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for glory and
   for beauty.

   ^3And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, whom I have
   filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make Aaron's garments
   to consecrate him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.

   ^4And these are the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and
   an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle: and
   they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that
   he may minister unto me in the priest's office.

   ^5And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
   linen.

   ^6And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple, of
   scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.

   ^7It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two edges
   thereof; and so it shall be joined together.

   ^8And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is upon it, shall be of
   the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold, of blue, and
   purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

   ^9And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the names of
   the children of Israel:

   ^10Six of their names on one stone, and the other six names of the rest
   on the other stone, according to their birth.

   ^11With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a
   signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones with the names of the
   children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be set in ouches of gold.

   ^12And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod
   for stones of memorial unto the children of Israel: and Aaron shall
   bear their names before the Lord upon his two shoulders for a memorial.

   ^13And thou shalt make ouches of gold;

   ^14And two chains of pure gold at the ends; of wreathen work shalt thou
   make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the ouches.

   ^15And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work;
   after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold, of blue, and
   of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined linen, shalt thou make
   it.

   ^16Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the length
   thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.

   ^17And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, even four rows of
   stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle:
   this shall be the first row.

   ^18And the second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

   ^19And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

   ^20And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they shall be
   set in gold in their inclosings.

   ^21And the stones shall be with the names of the children of Israel,
   twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet;
   every one with his name shall they be according to the twelve tribes.

   ^22And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends of
   wreathen work of pure gold.

   ^23And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and
   shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.

   ^24And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings
   which are on the ends of the breastplate.

   ^25And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt fasten
   in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod
   before it.

   ^26And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them upon
   the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof, which is in the
   side of the ephod inward.

   ^27And two other rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put them on
   the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart thereof,
   over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of
   the ephod.

   ^28And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the
   rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be above the
   curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not loosed
   from the ephod.

   ^29And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the
   breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy
   place, for a memorial before the Lord continually.

   ^30And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the
   Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before
   the Lord: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel
   upon his heart before the Lord continually.

   ^31And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue.

   ^32And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst thereof:
   it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it
   were the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent.

   ^33And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue,
   and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and bells
   of gold between them round about:

   ^34A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate,
   upon the hem of the robe round about.

   ^35And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be heard
   when he goeth in unto the holy place before the Lord, and when he
   cometh out, that he die not.

   ^36And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like
   the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE Lord.

   ^37And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the mitre;
   upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be.

   ^38And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the
   iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow
   in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that
   they may be accepted before the Lord.

   ^39And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou shalt make
   the mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make the girdle of needlework.

   ^40And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for
   them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them, for glory and for
   beauty.

   ^41And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons with
   him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them,
   that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

   ^42And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their nakedness;
   from the loins even unto the thighs they shall reach:

   ^43And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they come in
   unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near unto
   the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity,
   and die: it shall be a statute for ever unto him and his seed after
   him.

    Chapter 29

   And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to
   minister unto me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock, and
   two rams without blemish,

   ^2And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and
   wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shalt thou make
   them.

   ^3And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the
   basket, with the bullock and the two rams.

   ^4And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water.

   ^5And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and
   the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him
   with the curious girdle of the ephod:

   ^6And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown
   upon the mitre.

   ^7Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head,
   and anoint him.

   ^8And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.

   ^9And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put
   the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be theirs for a
   perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons.

   ^10And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle
   of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon
   the head of the bullock.

   ^11And thou shalt kill the bullock before the Lord, by the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^12And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the
   horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the
   bottom of the altar.

   ^13And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the
   caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is
   upon them, and burn them upon the altar.

   ^14But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou
   burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering.

   ^15Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their
   hands upon the head of the ram.

   ^16And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and
   sprinkle it round about upon the altar.

   ^17And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him,
   and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his head.

   ^18And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt
   offering unto the Lord: it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire
   unto the Lord.

   ^19And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put
   their hands upon the head of the ram.

   ^20Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it upon
   the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of
   his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great
   toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round
   about.

   ^21And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the
   anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and
   upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall
   be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments
   with him.

   ^22Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat
   that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two
   kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it
   is a ram of consecration:

   ^23And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer
   out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the Lord:

   ^24And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of
   his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the Lord.

   ^25And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the
   altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the Lord: it is
   an offering made by fire unto the Lord.

   ^26And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration,
   and wave it for a wave offering before the Lord: and it shall be thy
   part.

   ^27And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the
   shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up,
   of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of
   that which is for his sons:

   ^28And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the
   children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an
   heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their
   peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the Lord.

   ^29And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be
   anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.

   ^30And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven
   days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to
   minister in the holy place.

   ^31And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his
   flesh in the holy place.

   ^32And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread
   that is in the basket, by the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation.

   ^33And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to
   consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof,
   because they are holy.

   ^34And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread,
   remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire:
   it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.

   ^35And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all
   things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate
   them.

   ^36And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for
   atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an
   atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.

   ^37Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify
   it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar
   shall be holy.

   ^38Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of
   the first year day by day continually.

   ^39The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb
   thou shalt offer at even:

   ^40And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth
   part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for
   a drink offering.

   ^41And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto
   according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the
   drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire
   unto the Lord.

   ^42This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations
   at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord:
   where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee.

   ^43And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the
   tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.

   ^44And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the
   altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me
   in the priest's office.

   ^45And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their
   God.

   ^46And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, that brought them
   forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the
   Lord their God.

    Chapter 30

   And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood
   shalt thou make it.

   ^2A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof;
   foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the
   horns thereof shall be of the same.

   ^3And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the
   sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make
   unto it a crown of gold round about.

   ^4And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by
   the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it;
   and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal.

   ^5And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with
   gold.

   ^6And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the
   testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I
   will meet with thee.

   ^7And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he
   dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.

   ^8And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon
   it, a perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your generations.

   ^9Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor
   meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon.

   ^10And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a
   year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year
   shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most
   holy unto the Lord.

   ^11And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^12When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their
   number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the
   Lord, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them,
   when thou numberest them.

   ^13This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are
   numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is
   twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the Lord.

   ^14Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty
   years old and above, shall give an offering unto the Lord.

   ^15The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than
   half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the Lord, to make an
   atonement for your souls.

   ^16And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel,
   and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the
   congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel
   before the Lord, to make an atonement for your souls.

   ^17And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^18Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass,
   to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the
   congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.

   ^19For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet
   thereat:

   ^20When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall
   wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar
   to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the Lord:

   ^21So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not:
   and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed
   throughout their generations.

   ^22Moreover the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^23Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five
   hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred
   and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,

   ^24And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the
   sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:

   ^25And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound
   after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.

   ^26And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith,
   and the ark of the testimony,

   ^27And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his
   vessels, and the altar of incense,

   ^28And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver
   and his foot.

   ^29And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever
   toucheth them shall be holy.

   ^30And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that
   they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

   ^31And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall
   be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.

   ^32Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any
   other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be
   holy unto you.

   ^33Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it
   upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.

   ^34And the Lord said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte,
   and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of
   each shall there be a like weight:

   ^35And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the
   apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:

   ^36And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the
   testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with
   thee: it shall be unto you most holy.

   ^37And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to
   yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee
   holy for the Lord.

   ^38Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be
   cut off from his people.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 31

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur,
   of the tribe of Judah:

   ^3And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in
   understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,

   ^4To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in
   brass,

   ^5And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to
   work in all manner of workmanship.

   ^6And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach,
   of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I
   have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee;

   ^7The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and
   the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the
   tabernacle,

   ^8And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all
   his furniture, and the altar of incense,

   ^9And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver
   and his foot,

   ^10And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the
   priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's
   office,

   ^11And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place:
   according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.

   ^12And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^13Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my
   sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout
   your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth
   sanctify you.

   ^14Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every
   one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth
   any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

   ^15Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of
   rest, holy to the Lord: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he
   shall surely be put to death.

   ^16Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe
   the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.

   ^17It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in
   six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he
   rested, and was refreshed.

   ^18And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with
   him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written
   with the finger of God.

    Chapter 32

   And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the
   mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said
   unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this
   Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not
   what is become of him.

   ^2And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in
   the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring
   them unto me.

   ^3And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their
   ears, and brought them unto Aaron.

   ^4And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving
   tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy
   gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

   ^5And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made
   proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the Lord.

   ^6And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings,
   and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to
   drink, and rose up to play.

   ^7And the Lord said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people,
   which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted
   themselves:

   ^8They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them:
   they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have
   sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have
   brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

   ^9And the Lord said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold,
   it is a stiffnecked people:

   ^10Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them,
   and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.

   ^11And Moses besought the Lord his God, and said, Lord, why doth thy
   wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of
   the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?

   ^12Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he
   bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from
   the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this
   evil against thy people.

   ^13Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou
   swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your
   seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of
   will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.

   ^14And the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his
   people.

   ^15And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables
   of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both
   their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.

   ^16And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing
   of God, graven upon the tables.

   ^17And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he
   said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.

   ^18And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery,
   neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the
   noise of them that sing do I hear.

   ^19And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he
   saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast
   the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.

   ^20And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire,
   and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the
   children of Israel drink of it.

   ^21And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou
   hast brought so great a sin upon them?

   ^22And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest
   the people, that they are set on mischief.

   ^23For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for
   as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt,
   we wot not what is become of him.

   ^24And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it
   off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came
   out this calf.

   ^25And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made
   them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)

   ^26Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the
   Lord'S side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered
   themselves together unto him.

   ^27And he said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every
   man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate
   throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his
   companion, and every man his neighbour.

   ^28And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and
   there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.

   ^29For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the Lord, even
   every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon
   you a blessing this day.

   ^30And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people,
   Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the Lord;
   peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.

   ^31And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Oh, this people have
   sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.

   ^32Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I
   pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.

   ^33And the Lord said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him
   will I blot out of my book.

   ^34Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have
   spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless
   in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.

   ^35And the Lord plagued the people, because they made the calf, which
   Aaron made.

    Chapter 33

   And the Lord said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the
   people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the
   land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto
   thy seed will I give it:

   ^2And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the
   Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite,
   and the Jebusite:

   ^3Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the
   midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee
   in the way.

   ^4And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no
   man did put on him his ornaments.

   ^5For the Lord had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye
   are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a
   moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from
   thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.

   ^6And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by
   the mount Horeb.

   ^7And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar
   off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation.
   And it came to pass, that every one which sought the Lord went out unto
   the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.

   ^8And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that
   all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and
   looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.

   ^9And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy
   pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord
   talked with Moses.

   ^10And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle
   door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent
   door.

   ^11And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto
   his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua,
   the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.

   ^12And Moses said unto the Lord, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up
   this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me.
   Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace
   in my sight.

   ^13Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew
   me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy
   sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.

   ^14And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee
   rest.

   ^15And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not
   up hence.

   ^16For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found
   grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we
   be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the
   face of the earth.

   ^17And the Lord said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou
   hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by
   name.

   ^18And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.

   ^19And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I
   will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee; and will be gracious to
   whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.

   ^20And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see
   me, and live.

   ^21And the Lord said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt
   stand upon a rock:

   ^22And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will
   put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while
   I pass by:

   ^23And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts:
   but my face shall not be seen.

    Chapter 34

   And the Lord said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto
   the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in
   the first tables, which thou brakest.

   ^2And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount
   Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.

   ^3And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen
   throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before
   that mount.

   ^4And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose
   up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the Lord had
   commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.

   ^5And the Lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and
   proclaimed the name of the Lord.

   ^6And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord
   God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and
   truth,

   ^7Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and
   sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity
   of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children,
   unto the third and to the fourth generation.

   ^8And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and
   worshipped.

   ^9And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my
   Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and
   pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.

   ^10And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will
   do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any
   nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of
   the Lord: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.

   ^11Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out
   before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the
   Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

   ^12Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants
   of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of
   thee:

   ^13But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down
   their groves:

   ^14For thou shalt worship no other god: for the Lord, whose name is
   Jealous, is a jealous God:

   ^15Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they
   go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and
   one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;

   ^16And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters
   go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after
   their gods.

   ^17Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.

   ^18The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt
   eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month
   Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.

   ^19All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy
   cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.

   ^20But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if
   thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn
   of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.

   ^21Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in
   earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.

   ^22And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of
   wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.

   ^23Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the
   Lord GOD, the God of Israel.

   ^24For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy
   borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up
   to appear before the Lord thy God thrice in the year.

   ^25Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither
   shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the
   morning.

   ^26The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the
   house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's
   milk.

   ^27And the Lord said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the
   tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.

   ^28And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he did
   neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the
   words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

   ^29And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the
   two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the
   mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he
   talked with him.

   ^30And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the
   skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.

   ^31And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the
   congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.

   ^32And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them
   in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him in mount Sinai.

   ^33And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his
   face.

   ^34But when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he took
   the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the
   children of Israel that which he was commanded.

   ^35And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of
   Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he
   went in to speak with him.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 35

   And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel
   together, and said unto them, These are the words which the Lord hath
   commanded, that ye should do them.

   ^2Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to
   you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the Lord: whosoever doeth work
   therein shall be put to death.

   ^3Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath
   day.

   ^4And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel,
   saying, This is the thing which the Lord commanded, saying,

   ^5Take ye from among you an offering unto the Lord: whosoever is of a
   willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the Lord; gold, and
   silver, and brass,

   ^6And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,

   ^7And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,

   ^8And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the
   sweet incense,

   ^9And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the
   breastplate.

   ^10And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the
   Lord hath commanded;

   ^11The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his
   boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,

   ^12The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the vail
   of the covering,

   ^13The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the shewbread,

   ^14The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his
   lamps, with the oil for the light,

   ^15And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and
   the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of
   the tabernacle,

   ^16The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and
   all his vessels, the laver and his foot,

   ^17The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the
   hanging for the door of the court,

   ^18The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their
   cords,

   ^19The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy
   garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to
   minister in the priest's office.

   ^20And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the
   presence of Moses.

   ^21And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one
   whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the Lord'S offering to
   the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his
   service, and for the holy garments.

   ^22And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted,
   and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels
   of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto
   the Lord.

   ^23And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet,
   and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers'
   skins, brought them.

   ^24Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the
   Lord'S offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for
   any work of the service, brought it.

   ^25And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands,
   and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and
   of scarlet, and of fine linen.

   ^26And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats'
   hair.

   ^27And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the
   ephod, and for the breastplate;

   ^28And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for
   the sweet incense.

   ^29The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the Lord,
   every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all
   manner of work, which the Lord had commanded to be made by the hand of
   Moses.

   ^30And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the Lord hath
   called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of
   Judah;

   ^31And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in
   understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;

   ^32And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in
   brass,

   ^33And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood,
   to make any manner of cunning work.

   ^34And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and
   Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

   ^35Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of
   work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the
   embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and
   of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise
   cunning work.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 36

   Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom
   the Lord put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of
   work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the Lord
   had commanded.

   ^2And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in
   whose heart the Lord had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred
   him up to come unto the work to do it:

   ^3And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of
   Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to
   make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every
   morning.

   ^4And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary,
   came every man from his work which they made;

   ^5And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than
   enough for the service of the work, which the Lord commanded to make.

   ^6And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed
   throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more
   work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained
   from bringing.

   ^7For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it,
   and too much.

   ^8And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the
   tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and
   purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.

   ^9The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the
   breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.

   ^10And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other
   five curtains he coupled one unto another.

   ^11And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the
   selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of
   another curtain, in the coupling of the second.

   ^12Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the
   edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops
   held one curtain to another.

   ^13And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto
   another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.

   ^14And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the
   tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.

   ^15The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the
   breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.

   ^16And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by
   themselves.

   ^17And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in
   the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain
   which coupleth the second.

   ^18And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that
   it might be one.

   ^19And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a
   covering of badgers' skins above that.

   ^20And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up.

   ^21The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one
   cubit and a half.

   ^22One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did
   he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

   ^23And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south
   side southward:

   ^24And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two
   sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under
   another board for his two tenons.

   ^25And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north
   corner, he made twenty boards,

   ^26And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and
   two sockets under another board.

   ^27And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.

   ^28And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two
   sides.

   ^29And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head
   thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.

   ^30And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets
   of silver, under every board two sockets.

   ^31And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one
   side of the tabernacle,

   ^32And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle,
   and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.

   ^33And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one
   end to the other.

   ^34And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold
   to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.

   ^35And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined
   linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.

   ^36And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid
   them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four
   sockets of silver.

   ^37And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple,
   and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;

   ^38And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their
   chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of
   brass.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 37

   And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half was
   the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit
   and a half the height of it:

   ^2And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a
   crown of gold to it round about.

   ^3And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners
   of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the
   other side of it.

   ^4And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.

   ^5And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear
   the ark.

   ^6And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was
   the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof.

   ^7And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made he
   them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;

   ^8One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other
   end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the
   two ends thereof.

   ^9And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered with
   their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even
   to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims.

   ^10And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the length
   thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the
   height thereof:

   ^11And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of
   gold round about.

   ^12Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and
   made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.

   ^13And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the
   four corners that were in the four feet thereof.

   ^14Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to
   bear the table.

   ^15And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold,
   to bear the table.

   ^16And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes, and
   his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of pure
   gold.

   ^17And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the
   candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his
   flowers, were of the same:

   ^18And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of
   the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the
   candlestick out of the other side thereof:

   ^19Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop
   and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a
   knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the
   candlestick.

   ^20And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops,
   and his flowers:

   ^21And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two
   branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same,
   according to the six branches going out of it.

   ^22Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was one
   beaten work of pure gold.

   ^23And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes,
   of pure gold.

   ^24Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.

   ^25And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of it was
   a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and two
   cubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same.

   ^26And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides
   thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown
   of gold round about.

   ^27And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the
   two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the
   staves to bear it withal.

   ^28And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.

   ^29And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet
   spices, according to the work of the apothecary.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 38

   And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five cubits
   was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it was
   foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.

   ^2And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns
   thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.

   ^3And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels,
   and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels
   thereof made he of brass.

   ^4And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass
   thereof beneath unto the midst of it.

   ^5And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be
   places for the staves.

   ^6And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass.

   ^7And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to
   bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards.

   ^8And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the
   lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the door of
   the tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^9And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of
   the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred cubits:

   ^10Their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the
   hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.

   ^11And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits, their
   pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the hooks of
   the pillars and their fillets of silver.

   ^12And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars
   ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets
   of silver.

   ^13And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.

   ^14The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits; their
   pillars three, and their sockets three.

   ^15And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that
   hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their
   sockets three.

   ^16All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen.

   ^17And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the
   pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their
   chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted
   with silver.

   ^18And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of blue,
   and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits was
   the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable
   to the hangings of the court.

   ^19And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four; their
   hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their
   fillets of silver.

   ^20And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about,
   were of brass.

   ^21This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of
   testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses,
   for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron
   the priest.

   ^22And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
   made all that the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^23And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an
   engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in
   purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.

   ^24All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the
   holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents,
   and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the
   sanctuary.

   ^25And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an
   hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and
   fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:

   ^26A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of
   the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty
   years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and
   five hundred and fifty men.

   ^27And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the
   sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the
   hundred talents, a talent for a socket.

   ^28And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made
   hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted them.

   ^29And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand
   and four hundred shekels.

   ^30And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of
   the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it,
   and all the vessels of the altar,

   ^31And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the
   court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the
   court round about.

    Chapter 39

   And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service,
   to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron;
   as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^2And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and
   fine twined linen.

   ^3And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires,
   to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in
   the fine linen, with cunning work.

   ^4They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two
   edges was it coupled together.

   ^5And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the
   same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and
   scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^6And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as
   signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.

   ^7And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be
   stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the Lord commanded
   Moses.

   ^8And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the
   ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

   ^9It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the
   length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.

   ^10And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius,
   a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.

   ^11And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

   ^12And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

   ^13And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were
   inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.

   ^14And the stones were according to the names of the children of
   Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a
   signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.

   ^15And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen
   work of pure gold.

   ^16And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the
   two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.

   ^17And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the
   ends of the breastplate.

   ^18And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two
   ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it.

   ^19And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the
   breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod
   inward.

   ^20And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides
   of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the
   other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.

   ^21And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the
   ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of
   the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod;
   as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^22And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.

   ^23And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an
   habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.

   ^24And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and
   purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.

   ^25And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the
   pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the
   pomegranates;

   ^26A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the
   hem of the robe to minister in; as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^27And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for
   his sons,

   ^28And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and
   linen breeches of fine twined linen,

   ^29And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and
   scarlet, of needlework; as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^30And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote
   upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE
   Lord.

   ^31And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the
   mitre; as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^32Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the
   congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all
   that the Lord commanded Moses, so did they.

   ^33And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his
   furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his
   sockets,

   ^34And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of
   badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,

   ^35The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy
   seat,

   ^36The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,

   ^37The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to
   be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,

   ^38And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense,
   and the hanging for the tabernacle door,

   ^39The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his
   vessels, the laver and his foot,

   ^40The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the
   hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the
   vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the
   congregation,

   ^41The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy
   garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in
   the priest's office.

   ^42According to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so the children of
   Israel made all the work.

   ^43And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it
   as the Lord had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed
   them.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 40

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle
   of the tent of the congregation.

   ^3And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the
   ark with the vail.

   ^4And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that
   are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the
   candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.

   ^5And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark
   of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.

   ^6And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of
   the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

   ^7And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and
   the altar, and shalt put water therein.

   ^8And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging
   at the court gate.

   ^9And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and
   all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof:
   and it shall be holy.

   ^10And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his
   vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.

   ^11And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.

   ^12And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

   ^13And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and
   sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.

   ^14And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:

   ^15And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that
   they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing
   shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.

   ^16Thus did Moses: according to all that the Lord commanded him, so did
   he.

   ^17And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the
   first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.

   ^18And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and
   set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up
   his pillars.

   ^19And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the
   covering of the tent above upon it; as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^20And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves
   on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:

   ^21And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of
   the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the Lord
   commanded Moses.

   ^22And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side
   of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.

   ^23And he set the bread in order upon it before the Lord; as the Lord
   had commanded Moses.

   ^24And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over
   against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.

   ^25And he lighted the lamps before the Lord; as the Lord commanded
   Moses.

   ^26And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before
   the vail:

   ^27And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^28And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.

   ^29And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle
   of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering
   and the meat offering; as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^30And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the
   altar, and put water there, to wash withal.

   ^31And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet
   thereat:

   ^32When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came
   near unto the altar, they washed; as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^33And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar,
   and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.

   ^34Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of
   the Lord filled the tabernacle.

   ^35And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation,
   because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the
   tabernacle.

   ^36And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the
   children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:

   ^37But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the
   day that it was taken up.

   ^38For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire
   was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout
   all their journeys.

  The Second Book of Moses, called

Leviticus
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 1

   And the Lord called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the
   tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

   ^2Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of
   you bring an offering unto the Lord, ye shall bring your offering of
   the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock.

   ^3If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a
   male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at
   the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord.

   ^4And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it
   shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

   ^5And he shall kill the bullock before the Lord: and the priests,
   Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about
   upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation.

   ^6And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.

   ^7And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and
   lay the wood in order upon the fire:

   ^8And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the
   fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the
   altar:

   ^9But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest
   shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made
   by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.

   ^10And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of
   the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without
   blemish.

   ^11And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the
   Lord: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round
   about upon the altar.

   ^12And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and
   the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire
   which is upon the altar:

   ^13But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the
   priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt
   sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.

   ^14And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the Lord be of fowls,
   then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.

   ^15And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his
   head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung
   out at the side of the altar:

   ^16And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it
   beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:

   ^17And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide
   it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood
   that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by
   fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.

    Chapter 2

   And when any will offer a meat offering unto the Lord, his offering
   shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put
   frankincense thereon:

   ^2And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take
   thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with
   all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of
   it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour
   unto the Lord:

   ^3And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons':
   it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire.

   ^4And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven,
   it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or
   unleavened wafers anointed with oil.

   ^5And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be of
   fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.

   ^6Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat
   offering.

   ^7And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it
   shall be made of fine flour with oil.

   ^8And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things
   unto the Lord: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring
   it unto the altar.

   ^9And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof,
   and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a
   sweet savour unto the Lord.

   ^10And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his
   sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by
   fire.

   ^11No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the Lord, shall be made
   with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any
   offering of the Lord made by fire.

   ^12As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the
   Lord: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.

   ^13And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt;
   neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be
   lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt
   offer salt.

   ^14And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the Lord,
   thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of
   corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.

   ^15And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is
   a meat offering.

   ^16And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten
   corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense
   thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 3

   And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of
   the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without
   blemish before the Lord.

   ^2And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it
   at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the
   priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.

   ^3And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering
   made by fire unto the Lord; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all
   the fat that is upon the inwards,

   ^4And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the
   flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he
   take away.

   ^5And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice,
   which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by
   fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.

   ^6And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the Lord
   be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.

   ^7If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before
   the Lord.

   ^8And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it
   before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons shall
   sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar.

   ^9And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering
   made by fire unto the Lord; the fat thereof, and the whole rump, it
   shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the
   inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,

   ^10And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the
   flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he
   take away.

   ^11And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the
   offering made by fire unto the Lord.

   ^12And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the
   Lord.

   ^13And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before
   the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall
   sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.

   ^14And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by
   fire unto the Lord; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat
   that is upon the inwards,

   ^15And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the
   flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he
   take away.

   ^16And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the
   offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the Lord'S.

   ^17It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all
   your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.

    Chapter 4

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin
   through ignorance against any of the commandments of the Lord
   concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any
   of them:

   ^3If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the
   people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young
   bullock without blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering.

   ^4And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation before the Lord; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's
   head, and kill the bullock before the Lord.

   ^5And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood,
   and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:

   ^6And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the
   blood seven times before the Lord, before the vail of the sanctuary.

   ^7And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the
   altar of sweet incense before the Lord, which is in the tabernacle of
   the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the
   bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^8And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin
   offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is
   upon the inwards,

   ^9And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the
   flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he
   take away,

   ^10As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace
   offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt
   offering.

   ^11And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and
   with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,

   ^12Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a
   clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood
   with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.

   ^13And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and
   the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done
   somewhat against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things
   which should not be done, and are guilty;

   ^14When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the
   congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him
   before the tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^15And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the
   head of the bullock before the Lord: and the bullock shall be killed
   before the Lord.

   ^16And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood
   to the tabernacle of the congregation:

   ^17And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and
   sprinkle it seven times before the Lord, even before the vail.

   ^18And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which
   is before the Lord, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and
   shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt
   offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^19And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar.

   ^20And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a
   sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an
   atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.

   ^21And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him
   as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the
   congregation.

   ^22When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance
   against any of the commandments of the Lord his God concerning things
   which should not be done, and is guilty;

   ^23Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he
   shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:

   ^24And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in
   the place where they kill the burnt offering before the Lord: it is a
   sin offering.

   ^25And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his
   finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and
   shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.

   ^26And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the
   sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement
   for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.

   ^27And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he
   doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning
   things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;

   ^28Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he
   shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish,
   for his sin which he hath sinned.

   ^29And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and
   slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.

   ^30And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and
   put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour
   out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.

   ^31And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away
   from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it
   upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the Lord; and the priest shall
   make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.

   ^32And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a
   female without blemish.

   ^33And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and
   slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt
   offering.

   ^34And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his
   finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and
   shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:

   ^35And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb
   is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest
   shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire
   unto the Lord: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that
   he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.

    Chapter 5

   And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness,
   whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he
   shall bear his iniquity.

   ^2Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of an
   unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of
   unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be
   unclean, and guilty.

   ^3Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it be
   that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he
   knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.

   ^4Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do
   good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it
   be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one
   of these.

   ^5And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that
   he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing:

   ^6And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord for his sin
   which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the
   goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for
   him concerning his sin.

   ^7And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his
   trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young
   pigeons, unto the Lord; one for a sin offering, and the other for a
   burnt offering.

   ^8And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which
   is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his neck,
   but shall not divide it asunder:

   ^9And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side
   of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the
   bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering.

   ^10And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the
   manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin
   which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.

   ^11But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young
   pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth
   part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil
   upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin
   offering.

   ^12Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his
   handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar,
   according to the offerings made by fire unto the Lord: it is a sin
   offering.

   ^13And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin
   that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and
   the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.

   ^14And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^15If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy
   things of the Lord; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the Lord
   a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels
   of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering:

   ^16And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy
   thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the
   priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of
   the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.

   ^17And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are
   forbidden to be done by the commandments of the Lord; though he wist it
   not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.

   ^18And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy
   estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest
   shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he
   erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.

   ^19It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the
   Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 6

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the Lord, and lie unto
   his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in
   fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his
   neighbour;

   ^3Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and
   sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning
   therein:

   ^4Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he
   shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he
   hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or
   the lost thing which he found,

   ^5Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore
   it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, and
   give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass
   offering.

   ^6And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord, a ram without
   blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering,
   unto the priest:

   ^7And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the Lord: and
   it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in
   trespassing therein.

   ^8And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^9Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt
   offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the
   altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be
   burning in it.

   ^10And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen
   breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the
   fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall
   put them beside the altar.

   ^11And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and
   carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.

   ^12And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be
   put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay
   the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat
   of the peace offerings.

   ^13The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go
   out.

   ^14And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall
   offer it before the Lord, before the altar.

   ^15And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat
   offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is
   upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet
   savour, even the memorial of it, unto the Lord.

   ^16And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with
   unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of
   the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.

   ^17It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for
   their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the
   sin offering, and as the trespass offering.

   ^18All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall
   be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of
   the Lord made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy.

   ^19And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^20This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall
   offer unto the Lord in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of
   an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the
   morning, and half thereof at night.

   ^21In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou shalt
   bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer
   for a sweet savour unto the Lord.

   ^22And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer
   it: it is a statute for ever unto the Lord; it shall be wholly burnt.

   ^23For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it
   shall not be eaten.

   ^24And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^25Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin
   offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin
   offering be killed before the Lord: it is most holy.

   ^26The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place
   shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^27Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when
   there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt
   wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.

   ^28But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if
   it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in
   water.

   ^29All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy.

   ^30And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the
   tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place,
   shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 7

   Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy.

   ^2In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the
   trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about
   upon the altar.

   ^3And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat
   that covereth the inwards,

   ^4And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the
   flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it
   shall he take away:

   ^5And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by
   fire unto the Lord: it is a trespass offering.

   ^6Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in
   the holy place: it is most holy.

   ^7As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law
   for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it.

   ^8And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the
   priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he
   hath offered.

   ^9And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is
   dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that
   offereth it.

   ^10And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the
   sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.

   ^11And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
   shall offer unto the Lord.

   ^12If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the
   sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and
   unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of
   fine flour, fried.

   ^13Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread
   with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.

   ^14And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave
   offering unto the Lord, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth
   the blood of the peace offerings.

   ^15And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
   thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall
   not leave any of it until the morning.

   ^16But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary
   offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his
   sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:

   ^17But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day
   shall be burnt with fire.

   ^18And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be
   eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall
   it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination,
   and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.

   ^19And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it
   shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall
   eat thereof.

   ^20But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
   offerings, that pertain unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him,
   even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

   ^21Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the
   uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean
   thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which
   pertain unto the Lord, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.

   ^22And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^23Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of
   fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.

   ^24And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that
   which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall
   in no wise eat of it.

   ^25For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an
   offering made by fire unto the Lord, even the soul that eateth it shall
   be cut off from his people.

   ^26Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or
   of beast, in any of your dwellings.

   ^27Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that
   soul shall be cut off from his people.

   ^28And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^29Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the
   sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the Lord shall bring his oblation
   unto the Lord of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.

   ^30His own hands shall bring the offerings of the Lord made by fire,
   the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be
   waved for a wave offering before the Lord.

   ^31And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast
   shall be Aaron's and his sons'.

   ^32And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave
   offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

   ^33He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace
   offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.

   ^34For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the
   children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings,
   and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a
   statute for ever from among the children of Israel.

   ^35This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing
   of his sons, out of the offerings of the Lord made by fire, in the day
   when he presented them to minister unto the Lord in the priest's
   office;

   ^36Which the Lord commanded to be given them of the children of Israel,
   in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout
   their generations.

   ^37This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of
   the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the
   consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;

   ^38Which the Lord commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he
   commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the
   Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 8

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing
   oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of
   unleavened bread;

   ^3And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^4And Moses did as the Lord commanded him; and the assembly was
   gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^5And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the
   Lord commanded to be done.

   ^6And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.

   ^7And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and
   clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded
   him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him
   therewith.

   ^8And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate
   the Urim and the Thummim.

   ^9And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon
   his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the Lord
   commanded Moses.

   ^10And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and
   all that was therein, and sanctified them.

   ^11And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed
   the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify
   them.

   ^12And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed
   him, to sanctify him.

   ^13And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded
   them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the Lord commanded
   Moses.

   ^14And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his
   sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin
   offering.

   ^15And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns
   of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and
   poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make
   reconciliation upon it.

   ^16And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul
   above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned
   it upon the altar.

   ^17But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt
   with fire without the camp; as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^18And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his
   sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

   ^19And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round
   about.

   ^20And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the
   pieces, and the fat.

   ^21And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the
   whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour,
   and an offering made by fire unto the Lord; as the Lord commanded
   Moses.

   ^22And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and
   his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

   ^23And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon
   the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and
   upon the great toe of his right foot.

   ^24And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip
   of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon
   the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon
   the altar round about.

   ^25And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the
   inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their
   fat, and the right shoulder:

   ^26And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the Lord,
   he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer,
   and put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:

   ^27And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and
   waved them for a wave offering before the Lord.

   ^28And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the
   altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet
   savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord.

   ^29And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before
   the Lord: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the
   Lord commanded Moses.

   ^30And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon
   the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon
   his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron,
   and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him.

   ^31And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the
   door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the
   bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying,
   Aaron and his sons shall eat it.

   ^32And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn
   with fire.

   ^33And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at
   an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.

   ^34As he hath done this day, so the Lord hath commanded to do, to make
   an atonement for you.

   ^35Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the Lord,
   that ye die not: for so I am commanded.

   ^36So Aaron and his sons did all things which the Lord commanded by the
   hand of Moses.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 9

   And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his
   sons, and the elders of Israel;

   ^2And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering,
   and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before
   the Lord.

   ^3And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a
   kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the
   first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;

   ^4Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the
   Lord; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the Lord will
   appear unto you.

   ^5And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of
   the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before
   the Lord.

   ^6And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commanded that ye
   should do: and the glory of the Lord shall appear unto you.

   ^7And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin
   offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself,
   and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an
   atonement for them; as the Lord commanded.

   ^8Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin
   offering, which was for himself.

   ^9And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his
   finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured
   out the blood at the bottom of the altar:

   ^10But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the
   sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^11And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.

   ^12And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him
   the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.

   ^13And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces
   thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.

   ^14And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the
   burnt offering on the altar.

   ^15And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was
   the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin,
   as the first.

   ^16And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the
   manner.

   ^17And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and
   burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.

   ^18He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace
   offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto
   him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,

   ^19And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which
   covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:

   ^20And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the
   altar:

   ^21And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave
   offering before the Lord; as Moses commanded.

   ^22And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them,
   and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt
   offering, and peace offerings.

   ^23And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,
   and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the Lord
   appeared unto all the people.

   ^24And there came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed upon
   the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people
   saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 10

   And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer,
   and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire
   before the Lord, which he commanded them not.

   ^2And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them, and they
   died before the Lord.

   ^3Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the Lord spake, saying, I
   will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people
   I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.

   ^4And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle
   of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from
   before the sanctuary out of the camp.

   ^5So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp;
   as Moses had said.

   ^6And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his
   sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die,
   and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the
   whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the Lord hath kindled.

   ^7And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon
   you. And they did according to the word of Moses.

   ^8And the Lord spake unto Aaron, saying,

   ^9Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee,
   when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it
   shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations:

   ^10And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between
   unclean and clean;

   ^11And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which
   the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.

   ^12And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his
   sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the
   offerings of the Lord made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside
   the altar: for it is most holy:

   ^13And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and
   thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the Lord made by fire: for so I am
   commanded.

   ^14And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
   place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy
   due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace
   offerings of the children of Israel.

   ^15The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the
   offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering
   before the Lord; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a
   statute for ever; as the Lord hath commanded.

   ^16And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,
   behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the
   sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,

   ^17Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place,
   seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity
   of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord?

   ^18Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye
   should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.

   ^19And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their
   sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord; and such things
   have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it
   have been accepted in the sight of the Lord?

   ^20And when Moses heard that, he was content.

    Chapter 11

   And the Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,

   ^2Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which
   ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.

   ^3Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the
   cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.

   ^4Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of
   them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud,
   but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.

   ^5And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof;
   he is unclean unto you.

   ^6And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof;
   he is unclean unto you.

   ^7And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he
   cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.

   ^8Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not
   touch; they are unclean to you.

   ^9These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath
   fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them
   shall ye eat.

   ^10And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the
   rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which
   is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:

   ^11They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of
   their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.

   ^12Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an
   abomination unto you.

   ^13And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the
   fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and
   the ossifrage, and the ospray,

   ^14And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;

   ^15Every raven after his kind;

   ^16And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after
   his kind,

   ^17And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,

   ^18And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,

   ^19And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the
   bat.

   ^20All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination
   unto you.

   ^21Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon
   all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the
   earth;

   ^22Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the
   bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the
   grasshopper after his kind.

   ^23But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be
   an abomination unto you.

   ^24And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of
   them shall be unclean until the even.

   ^25And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his
   clothes, and be unclean until the even.

   ^26The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not
   clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that
   toucheth them shall be unclean.

   ^27And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that
   go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their
   carcase shall be unclean until the even.

   ^28And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and
   be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.

   ^29These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that
   creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after
   his kind,

   ^30And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail,
   and the mole.

   ^31These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch
   them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.

   ^32And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it
   shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or
   skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it
   must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it
   shall be cleansed.

   ^33And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever
   is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.

   ^34Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh
   shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel
   shall be unclean.

   ^35And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be
   unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken
   down: for they are unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.

   ^36Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water,
   shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.

   ^37And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is
   to be sown, it shall be clean.

   ^38But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcase
   fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.

   ^39And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the
   carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.

   ^40And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and
   be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall
   wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

   ^41And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an
   abomination; it shall not be eaten.

   ^42Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four,
   or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon
   the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.

   ^43Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that
   creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye
   should be defiled thereby.

   ^44For I am the Lord your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves,
   and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves
   with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

   ^45For I am the Lord that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to
   be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.

   ^46This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living
   creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth
   upon the earth:

   ^47To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between
   the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.

    Chapter 12

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived
   seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days;
   according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be
   unclean.

   ^3And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.

   ^4And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and
   thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the
   sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.

   ^5But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as
   in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying
   threescore and six days.

   ^6And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a
   daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt
   offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto
   the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:

   ^7Who shall offer it before the Lord, and make an atonement for her;
   and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law
   for her that hath born a male or a female.

   ^8And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two
   turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the
   other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for
   her, and she shall be clean.

    Chapter 13

   And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,

   ^2When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or
   bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of
   leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of
   his sons the priests:

   ^3And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and
   when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be
   deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the
   priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.

   ^4If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be
   not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white;
   then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days:

   ^5And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the
   plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the
   skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:

   ^6And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold,
   if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin,
   the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall
   wash his clothes, and be clean.

   ^7But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath
   been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the
   priest again:

   ^8And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin,
   then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.

   ^9When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto
   the priest;

   ^10And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be white in
   the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw
   flesh in the rising;

   ^11It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall
   pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.

   ^12And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover
   all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his
   foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;

   ^13Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have
   covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the
   plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.

   ^14But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.

   ^15And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be
   unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.

   ^16Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall
   come unto the priest;

   ^17And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be turned
   into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the
   plague: he is clean.

   ^18The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and
   is healed,

   ^19And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright
   spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest;

   ^20And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than
   the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall
   pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the
   boil.

   ^21But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs
   therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark;
   then the priest shall shut him up seven days:

   ^22And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall
   pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.

   ^23But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a
   burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

   ^24Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot
   burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot,
   somewhat reddish, or white;

   ^25Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the
   bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin;
   it is a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall
   pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.

   ^26But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in
   the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be
   somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:

   ^27And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be
   spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him
   unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.

   ^28And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the
   skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the
   priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the
   burning.

   ^29If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;

   ^30Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight
   deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the
   priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a leprosy
   upon the head or beard.

   ^31And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it
   be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair
   in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the
   scall seven days:

   ^32And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and,
   behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and
   the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin;

   ^33He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest
   shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:

   ^34And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and,
   behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper
   than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall
   wash his clothes, and be clean.

   ^35But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;

   ^36Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be
   spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is
   unclean.

   ^37But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black
   hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest
   shall pronounce him clean.

   ^38If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright
   spots, even white bright spots;

   ^39Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots in the
   skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled spot that
   groweth in the skin; he is clean.

   ^40And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he
   clean.

   ^41And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head
   toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.

   ^42And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish
   sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.

   ^43Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising of
   the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as
   the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;

   ^44He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him
   utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.

   ^45And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and
   his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and
   shall cry, Unclean, unclean.

   ^46All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled;
   he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his
   habitation be.

   ^47The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a
   woollen garment, or a linen garment;

   ^48Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether
   in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;

   ^49And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the
   skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it
   is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest:

   ^50And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that hath
   the plague seven days:

   ^51And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be
   spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a
   skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the plague is a fretting
   leprosy; it is unclean.

   ^52He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in
   woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for
   it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.

   ^53And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread
   in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of
   skin;

   ^54Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the
   plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:

   ^55And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed:
   and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague
   be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is
   fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.

   ^56And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark
   after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or
   out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:

   ^57And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the
   woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt
   burn that wherein the plague is with fire.

   ^58And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin
   it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then
   it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.

   ^59This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or
   linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce
   it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

    Chapter 14

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He
   shall be brought unto the priest:

   ^3And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall
   look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper;

   ^4Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed
   two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

   ^5And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an
   earthen vessel over running water:

   ^6As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the
   scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the
   blood of the bird that was killed over the running water:

   ^7And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the
   leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the
   living bird loose into the open field.

   ^8And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off
   all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and
   after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of
   his tent seven days.

   ^9But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair
   off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall
   shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh
   in water, and he shall be clean.

   ^10And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish,
   and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth
   deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log
   of oil.

   ^11And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is
   to be made clean, and those things, before the Lord, at the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation:

   ^12And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass
   offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before
   the Lord:

   ^13And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin
   offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin
   offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy:

   ^14And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass
   offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of
   him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and
   upon the great toe of his right foot:

   ^15And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into
   the palm of his own left hand:

   ^16And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his
   left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times
   before the Lord:

   ^17And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put
   upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon
   the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot,
   upon the blood of the trespass offering:

   ^18And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall
   pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall
   make an atonement for him before the Lord.

   ^19And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement
   for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he
   shall kill the burnt offering:

   ^20And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering
   upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he
   shall be clean.

   ^21And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one
   lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him,
   and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering,
   and a log of oil;

   ^22And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to
   get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt
   offering.

   ^23And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the
   priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the
   Lord.

   ^24And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the
   log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before
   the Lord:

   ^25And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest
   shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and put it upon
   the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the
   thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:

   ^26And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left
   hand:

   ^27And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil
   that is in his left hand seven times before the Lord:

   ^28And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip
   of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of
   his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the
   place of the blood of the trespass offering:

   ^29And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put
   upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for
   him before the Lord.

   ^30And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young
   pigeons, such as he can get;

   ^31Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the
   other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest
   shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the Lord.

   ^32This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand
   is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing.

   ^33And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

   ^34When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a
   possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of
   your possession;

   ^35And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying,
   It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house:

   ^36Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the
   priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be
   not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the
   house:

   ^37And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in
   the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which
   in sight are lower than the wall;

   ^38Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house,
   and shut up the house seven days:

   ^39And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look:
   and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house;

   ^40Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in
   which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place
   without the city:

   ^41And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and
   they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into
   an unclean place:

   ^42And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those
   stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house.

   ^43And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that
   he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and
   after it is plaistered;

   ^44Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be
   spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is
   unclean.

   ^45And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber
   thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth
   out of the city into an unclean place.

   ^46Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut
   up shall be unclean until the even.

   ^47And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that
   eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.

   ^48And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the
   plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered:
   then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is
   healed.

   ^49And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood,
   and scarlet, and hyssop:

   ^50And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over
   running water:

   ^51And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet,
   and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and
   in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:

   ^52And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with
   the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood,
   and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:

   ^53But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open
   fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean.

   ^54This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall,

   ^55And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,

   ^56And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:

   ^57To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law
   of leprosy.

    Chapter 15

   And the Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,

   ^2Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man
   hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is
   unclean.

   ^3And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run
   with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his
   uncleanness.

   ^4Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and
   every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.

   ^5And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe
   himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

   ^6And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the issue
   shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean
   until the even.

   ^7And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash
   his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

   ^8And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then he
   shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean
   until the even.

   ^9And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall be
   unclean.

   ^10And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean
   until the even: and he that beareth any of those things shall wash his
   clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

   ^11And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not rinsed
   his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in
   water, and be unclean until the even.

   ^12And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue,
   shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.

   ^13And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he
   shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his
   clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.

   ^14And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or two
   young pigeons, and come before the Lord unto the door of the tabernacle
   of the congregation, and give them unto the priest:

   ^15And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the
   other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for
   him before the Lord for his issue.

   ^16And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall
   wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even.

   ^17And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of
   copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even.

   ^18The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they
   shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even.

   ^19And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood,
   she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be
   unclean until the even.

   ^20And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be
   unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean.

   ^21And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe
   himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

   ^22And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his
   clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

   ^23And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth, when
   he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.

   ^24And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he
   shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be
   unclean.

   ^25And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time
   of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all
   the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her
   separation: she shall be unclean.

   ^26Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto
   her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall
   be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.

   ^27And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash
   his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

   ^28But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to
   herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

   ^29And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two
   young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^30And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other
   for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her
   before the Lord for the issue of her uncleanness.

   ^31Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their
   uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile
   my tabernacle that is among them.

   ^32This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed
   goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;

   ^33And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an
   issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her
   that is unclean.

    Chapter 16

   And the Lord spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron,
   when they offered before the Lord, and died;

   ^2And the Lord said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he
   come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the
   mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear
   in the cloud upon the mercy seat.

   ^3Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a
   sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.

   ^4He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen
   breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and
   with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments;
   therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.

   ^5And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two
   kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.

   ^6And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for
   himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.

   ^7And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the Lord at
   the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^8And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord,
   and the other lot for the scapegoat.

   ^9And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the Lord'S lot fell, and
   offer him for a sin offering.

   ^10But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be
   presented alive before the Lord, to make an atonement with him, and to
   let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.

   ^11And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for
   himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house,
   and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:

   ^12And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off
   the altar before the Lord, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten
   small, and bring it within the vail:

   ^13And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord, that the
   cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the
   testimony, that he die not:

   ^14And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with
   his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat
   shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.

   ^15Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the
   people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as
   he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy
   seat, and before the mercy seat:

   ^16And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the
   uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their
   transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle
   of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their
   uncleanness.

   ^17And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when
   he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out,
   and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for
   all the congregation of Israel.

   ^18And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the Lord, and make
   an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of
   the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round
   about.

   ^19And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven
   times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the
   children of Israel.

   ^20And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the
   tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live
   goat:

   ^21And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat,
   and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and
   all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head
   of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the
   wilderness:

   ^22And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land
   not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.

   ^23And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and
   shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the
   holy place, and shall leave them there:

   ^24And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on
   his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the
   burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and
   for the people.

   ^25And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.

   ^26And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his
   clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the
   camp.

   ^27And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin
   offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy
   place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in
   the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.

   ^28And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh
   in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.

   ^29And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh
   month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and
   do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger
   that sojourneth among you:

   ^30For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to
   cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord.

   ^31It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your
   souls, by a statute for ever.

   ^32And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate
   to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make
   the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy
   garments:

   ^33And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall
   make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the
   altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the
   people of the congregation.

   ^34And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an
   atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year.
   And he did as the Lord commanded Moses.

    Chapter 17

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of
   Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the Lord hath
   commanded, saying,

   ^3What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox,
   or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp,

   ^4And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation, to offer an offering unto the Lord before the tabernacle
   of the Lord; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood;
   and that man shall be cut off from among his people:

   ^5To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices,
   which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto
   the Lord, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the
   priest, and offer them for peace offerings unto the Lord.

   ^6And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the Lord at
   the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a
   sweet savour unto the Lord.

   ^7And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom
   they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them
   throughout their generations.

   ^8And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of
   Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a
   burnt offering or sacrifice,

   ^9And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation, to offer it unto the Lord; even that man shall be cut off
   from among his people.

   ^10And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the
   strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I
   will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut
   him off from among his people.

   ^11For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to
   you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the
   blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.

   ^12Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall
   eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat
   blood.

   ^13And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the
   strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast
   or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof,
   and cover it with dust.

   ^14For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life
   thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the
   blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood
   thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.

   ^15And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which
   was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a
   stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,
   and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.

   ^16But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his
   iniquity.

    Chapter 18

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the Lord
   your God.

   ^3After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not
   do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you,
   shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.

   ^4Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein:
   I am the Lord your God.

   ^5Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man
   do, he shall live in them: I am the Lord.

   ^6None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to
   uncover their nakedness: I am the Lord.

   ^7The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt
   thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her
   nakedness.

   ^8The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy
   father's nakedness.

   ^9The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter
   of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their
   nakedness thou shalt not uncover.

   ^10The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter,
   even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own
   nakedness.

   ^11The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy
   father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

   ^12Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is
   thy father's near kinswoman.

   ^13Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she
   is thy mother's near kinswoman.

   ^14Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou
   shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.

   ^15Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she is
   thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

   ^16Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is
   thy brother's nakedness.

   ^17Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter,
   neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter,
   to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is
   wickedness.

   ^18Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover
   her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.

   ^19Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness,
   as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.

   ^20Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to
   defile thyself with her.

   ^21And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to
   Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the Lord.

   ^22Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is
   abomination.

   ^23Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith:
   neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is
   confusion.

   ^24Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these
   the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:

   ^25And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof
   upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.

   ^26Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not
   commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor
   any stranger that sojourneth among you:

   ^27(For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which
   were before you, and the land is defiled;)

   ^28That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued
   out the nations that were before you.

   ^29For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls
   that commit them shall be cut off from among their people.

   ^30Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one
   of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that
   ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the Lord your God.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 19

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say
   unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy.

   ^3Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my
   sabbaths: I am the Lord your God.

   ^4Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the
   Lord your God.

   ^5And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord, ye
   shall offer it at your own will.

   ^6It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if
   ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.

   ^7And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it
   shall not be accepted.

   ^8Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because
   he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the Lord: and that soul shall be
   cut off from among his people.

   ^9And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap
   the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of
   thy harvest.

   ^10And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather
   every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and
   stranger: I am the Lord your God.

   ^11Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to
   another.

   ^12And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou
   profane the name of thy God: I am the Lord.

   ^13Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the wages of
   him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the
   morning.

   ^14Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the
   blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the Lord.

   ^15Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect
   the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in
   righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.

   ^16Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people:
   neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the
   Lord.

   ^17Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any
   wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.

   ^18Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of
   thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the
   Lord.

   ^19Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with
   a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither
   shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.

   ^20And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid,
   betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given
   her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she
   was not free.

   ^21And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the Lord, unto the
   door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass
   offering.

   ^22And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the
   trespass offering before the Lord for his sin which he hath done: and
   the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.

   ^23And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all
   manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as
   uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it
   shall not be eaten of.

   ^24But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise
   the Lord withal.

   ^25And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may
   yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the Lord your God.

   ^26Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use
   enchantment, nor observe times.

   ^27Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar
   the corners of thy beard.

   ^28Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print
   any marks upon you: I am the Lord.

   ^29Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the
   land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.

   ^30Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the
   Lord.

   ^31Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after
   wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God.

   ^32Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the
   old man, and fear thy God: I am the Lord.

   ^33And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex
   him.

   ^34But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one
   born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were
   strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.

   ^35Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight,
   or in measure.

   ^36Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye
   have: I am the Lord your God, which brought you out of the land of
   Egypt.

   ^37Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments,
   and do them: I am the Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 20

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of
   the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel,
   that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to
   death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.

   ^3And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from
   among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to
   defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

   ^4And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the
   man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:

   ^5Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and
   will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit
   whoredom with Molech, from among their people.

   ^6And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and
   after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face
   against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.

   ^7Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the Lord your
   God.

   ^8And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the Lord which
   sanctify you.

   ^9For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely
   put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall
   be upon him.

   ^10And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even
   he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer
   and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.

   ^11And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his
   father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their
   blood shall be upon them.

   ^12And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely
   be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon
   them.

   ^13If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of
   them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death;
   their blood shall be upon them.

   ^14And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they
   shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness
   among you.

   ^15And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and
   ye shall slay the beast.

   ^16And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou
   shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death;
   their blood shall be upon them.

   ^17And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his
   mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it
   is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their
   people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his
   iniquity.

   ^18And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall
   uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath
   uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off
   from among their people.

   ^19And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor
   of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear
   their iniquity.

   ^20And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his
   uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.

   ^21And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing:
   he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.

   ^22Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and
   do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you
   not out.

   ^23And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out
   before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I
   abhorred them.

   ^24But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will
   give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and
   honey: I am the Lord your God, which have separated you from other
   people.

   ^25Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean,
   and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls
   abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that
   creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.

   ^26And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the Lord am holy, and have
   severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.

   ^27A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a
   wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with
   stones: their blood shall be upon them.

    Chapter 21

   And the Lord said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron,
   and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his
   people:

   ^2But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and
   for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his
   brother,

   ^3And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no
   husband; for her may he be defiled.

   ^4But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people,
   to profane himself.

   ^5They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they
   shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their
   flesh.

   ^6They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their
   God: for the offerings of the Lord made by fire, and the bread of their
   God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.

   ^7They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall
   they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his
   God.

   ^8Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy
   God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the Lord, which sanctify you, am
   holy.

   ^9And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the
   whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.

   ^10And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head
   the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the
   garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes;

   ^11Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his
   father, or for his mother;

   ^12Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary
   of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him:
   I am the Lord.

   ^13And he shall take a wife in her virginity.

   ^14A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall
   he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.

   ^15Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the Lord
   do sanctify him.

   ^16And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^17Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their
   generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the
   bread of his God.

   ^18For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach:
   a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing
   superfluous,

   ^19Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,

   ^20Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be
   scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;

   ^21No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall
   come nigh to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire: he hath a
   blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.

   ^22He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the
   holy.

   ^23Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar,
   because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I
   the Lord do sanctify them.

   ^24And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the
   children of Israel.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 22

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from
   the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my
   holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the Lord.

   ^3Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your
   generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of
   Israel hallow unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul
   shall be cut off from my presence: I am the Lord.

   ^4What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running
   issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And
   whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose
   seed goeth from him;

   ^5Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made
   unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever
   uncleanness he hath;

   ^6The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and
   shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.

   ^7And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat
   of the holy things; because it is his food.

   ^8That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat
   to defile himself therewith: I am the Lord.

   ^9They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it,
   and die therefore, if they profane it: I the Lord do sanctify them.

   ^10There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the
   priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.

   ^11But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it,
   and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.

   ^12If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may
   not eat of an offering of the holy things.

   ^13But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no
   child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she
   shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall no stranger eat
   thereof.

   ^14And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put
   the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with
   the holy thing.

   ^15And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of
   Israel, which they offer unto the Lord;

   ^16Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their
   holy things: for I the Lord do sanctify them.

   ^17And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^18Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of
   Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or
   of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his
   vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto
   the Lord for a burnt offering;

   ^19Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the
   beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.

   ^20But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall
   not be acceptable for you.

   ^21And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord
   to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it
   shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.

   ^22Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed,
   ye shall not offer these unto the Lord, nor make an offering by fire of
   them upon the altar unto the Lord.

   ^23Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or
   lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering;
   but for a vow it shall not be accepted.

   ^24Ye shall not offer unto the Lord that which is bruised, or crushed,
   or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your
   land.

   ^25Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God
   of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be
   in them: they shall not be accepted for you.

   ^26And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^27When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it
   shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and
   thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the
   Lord.

   ^28And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young
   both in one day.

   ^29And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the Lord,
   offer it at your own will.

   ^30On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it
   until the morrow: I am the Lord.

   ^31Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the Lord.

   ^32Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among
   the children of Israel: I am the Lord which hallow you,

   ^33That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the
   Lord.

    Chapter 23

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the
   feasts of the Lord, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations,
   even these are my feasts.

   ^3Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of
   rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the
   sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings.

   ^4These are the feasts of the Lord, even holy convocations, which ye
   shall proclaim in their seasons.

   ^5In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the Lord'S
   passover.

   ^6And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened
   bread unto the Lord: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.

   ^7In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no
   servile work therein.

   ^8But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord seven days:
   in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work
   therein.

   ^9And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^10Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be
   come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest
   thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest
   unto the priest:

   ^11And he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you:
   on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.

   ^12And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb
   without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the Lord.

   ^13And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour
   mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the Lord for a sweet
   savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth
   part of an hin.

   ^14And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears,
   until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God:
   it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your
   dwellings.

   ^15And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from
   the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths
   shall be complete:

   ^16Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty
   days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the Lord.

   ^17Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth
   deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven;
   they are the firstfruits unto the Lord.

   ^18And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the
   first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a
   burnt offering unto the Lord, with their meat offering, and their drink
   offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the
   Lord.

   ^19Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and
   two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.

   ^20And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for
   a wave offering before the Lord, with the two lambs: they shall be holy
   to the Lord for the priest.

   ^21And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy
   convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it shall be
   a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.

   ^22And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean
   riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt
   thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the
   poor, and to the stranger: I am the Lord your God.

   ^23And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^24Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in
   the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of
   blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.

   ^25Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering
   made by fire unto the Lord.

   ^26And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^27Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of
   atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall
   afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord.

   ^28And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of
   atonement, to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God.

   ^29For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same
   day, he shall be cut off from among his people.

   ^30And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the
   same soul will I destroy from among his people.

   ^31Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever
   throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

   ^32It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your
   souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even,
   shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

   ^33And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^34Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this
   seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the
   Lord.

   ^35On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no
   servile work therein.

   ^36Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord: on
   the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall
   offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord: it is a solemn assembly;
   and ye shall do no servile work therein.

   ^37These are the feasts of the Lord, which ye shall proclaim to be holy
   convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, a burnt
   offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every
   thing upon his day:

   ^38Beside the sabbaths of the Lord, and beside your gifts, and beside
   all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give
   unto the Lord.

   ^39Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have
   gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the Lord
   seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day
   shall be a sabbath.

   ^40And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees,
   branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of
   the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days.

   ^41And ye shall keep it a feast unto the Lord seven days in the year.
   It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate
   it in the seventh month.

   ^42Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born
   shall dwell in booths:

   ^43That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to
   dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the
   Lord your God.

   ^44And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the
   Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 24

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil
   olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.

   ^3Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the
   congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning
   before the Lord continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your
   generations.

   ^4He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the Lord
   continually.

   ^5And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two
   tenth deals shall be in one cake.

   ^6And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure
   table before the Lord.

   ^7And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on
   the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the Lord.

   ^8Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the Lord continually,
   being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.

   ^9And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the
   holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the Lord
   made by fire by a perpetual statute.

   ^10And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian,
   went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish
   woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;

   ^11And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and
   cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name was
   Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)

   ^12And they put him in ward, that the mind of the Lord might be shewed
   them.

   ^13And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^14Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that
   heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation
   stone him.

   ^15And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever
   curseth his God shall bear his sin.

   ^16And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put
   to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well
   the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the
   name of the Lord, shall be put to death.

   ^17And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.

   ^18And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.

   ^19And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so
   shall it be done to him;

   ^20Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a
   blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.

   ^21And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that
   killeth a man, he shall be put to death.

   ^22Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for
   one of your own country: for I am the Lord your God.

   ^23And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring
   forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones.
   And the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses.

    Chapter 25

   And the Lord spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,

   ^2Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come
   into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto
   the Lord.

   ^3Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune
   thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;

   ^4But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a
   sabbath for the Lord: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy
   vineyard.

   ^5That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not
   reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year
   of rest unto the land.

   ^6And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for
   thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy
   stranger that sojourneth with thee,

   ^7And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all
   the increase thereof be meat.

   ^8And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times
   seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto
   thee forty and nine years.

   ^9Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth
   day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the
   trumpet sound throughout all your land.

   ^10And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
   throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a
   jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and
   ye shall return every man unto his family.

   ^11A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow,
   neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes
   in it of thy vine undressed.

   ^12For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the
   increase thereof out of the field.

   ^13In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
   possession.

   ^14And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy
   neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:

   ^15According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of
   thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he
   shall sell unto thee:

   ^16According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price
   thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the
   price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits
   doth he sell unto thee.

   ^17Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy
   God: for I am the Lord your God.

   ^18Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do
   them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.

   ^19And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and
   dwell therein in safety.

   ^20And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we
   shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:

   ^21Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it
   shall bring forth fruit for three years.

   ^22And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the
   ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.

   ^23The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye
   are strangers and sojourners with me.

   ^24And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption
   for the land.

   ^25If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his
   possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he
   redeem that which his brother sold.

   ^26And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem
   it;

   ^27Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the
   overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his
   possession.

   ^28But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold
   shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of
   jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his
   possession.

   ^29And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may
   redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may
   he redeem it.

   ^30And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the
   house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him
   that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the
   jubile.

   ^31But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them
   shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed,
   and they shall go out in the jubile.

   ^32Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the
   cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.

   ^33And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold,
   and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for
   the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the
   children of Israel.

   ^34But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it
   is their perpetual possession.

   ^35And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee;
   then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a
   sojourner; that he may live with thee.

   ^36Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy
   brother may live with thee.

   ^37Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy
   victuals for increase.

   ^38I am the Lord your God, which brought you forth out of the land of
   Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.

   ^39And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold
   unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:

   ^40But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee,
   and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile:

   ^41And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with
   him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of
   his fathers shall he return.

   ^42For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of
   Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.

   ^43Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.

   ^44Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be
   of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen
   and bondmaids.

   ^45Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you,
   of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which
   they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.

   ^46And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after
   you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for
   ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule
   one over another with rigour.

   ^47And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother
   that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or
   sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family:

   ^48After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren
   may redeem him:

   ^49Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is
   nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he
   may redeem himself.

   ^50And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he
   was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale
   shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of
   an hired servant shall it be with him.

   ^51If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give
   again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought
   for.

   ^52And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he
   shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him
   again the price of his redemption.

   ^53And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other
   shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.

   ^54And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in
   the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.

   ^55For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my
   servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord
   your God.

    Chapter 26

   Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a
   standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your
   land, to bow down unto it: for I am the Lord your God.

   ^2Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the Lord.

   ^3If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;

   ^4Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her
   increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.

   ^5And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage
   shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the
   full, and dwell in your land safely.

   ^6And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none
   shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land,
   neither shall the sword go through your land.

   ^7And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by
   the sword.

   ^8And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall
   put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by
   the sword.

   ^9For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply
   you, and establish my covenant with you.

   ^10And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the
   new.

   ^11And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor
   you.

   ^12And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my
   people.

   ^13I am the Lord your God, which brought you forth out of the land of
   Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands
   of your yoke, and made you go upright.

   ^14But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these
   commandments;

   ^15And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my
   judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye
   break my covenant:

   ^16I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror,
   consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and
   cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your
   enemies shall eat it.

   ^17And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before
   your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall
   flee when none pursueth you.

   ^18And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will
   punish you seven times more for your sins.

   ^19And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your
   heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:

   ^20And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not
   yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their
   fruits.

   ^21And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I
   will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.

   ^22I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your
   children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your
   high ways shall be desolate.

   ^23And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk
   contrary unto me;

   ^24Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet
   seven times for your sins.

   ^25And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of
   my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I
   will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the
   hand of the enemy.

   ^26And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake
   your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by
   weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.

   ^27And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary
   unto me;

   ^28Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will
   chastise you seven times for your sins.

   ^29And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your
   daughters shall ye eat.

   ^30And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and
   cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall
   abhor you.

   ^31And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto
   desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.

   ^32And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which
   dwell therein shall be astonished at it.

   ^33And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword
   after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.

   ^34Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth
   desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land
   rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.

   ^35As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest
   in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.

   ^36And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness
   into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a
   shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a
   sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.

   ^37And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword,
   when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your
   enemies.

   ^38And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies
   shall eat you up.

   ^39And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in
   your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall
   they pine away with them.

   ^40If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their
   fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that
   also they have walked contrary unto me;

   ^41And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought
   them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts
   be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:

   ^42Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant
   with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I
   will remember the land.

   ^43The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths,
   while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the
   punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my
   judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.

   ^44And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I
   will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them
   utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the Lord their
   God.

   ^45But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors,
   whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the
   heathen, that I might be their God: I am the Lord.

   ^46These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the Lord made
   between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of
   Moses.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 27

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man
   shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the Lord by thy
   estimation.

   ^3And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even
   unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of
   silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

   ^4And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.

   ^5And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy
   estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten
   shekels.

   ^6And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy
   estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the
   female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.

   ^7And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then
   thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten
   shekels.

   ^8But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present
   himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to
   his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.

   ^9And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the Lord,
   all that any man giveth of such unto the Lord shall be holy.

   ^10He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for
   a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the
   exchange thereof shall be holy.

   ^11And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a
   sacrifice unto the Lord, then he shall present the beast before the
   priest:

   ^12And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou
   valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.

   ^13But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part
   thereof unto thy estimation.

   ^14And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the Lord,
   then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the
   priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.

   ^15And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall
   add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall
   be his.

   ^16And if a man shall sanctify unto the Lord some part of a field of
   his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed
   thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of
   silver.

   ^17If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy
   estimation it shall stand.

   ^18But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall
   reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto
   the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.

   ^19And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then
   he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and
   it shall be assured to him.

   ^20And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to
   another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.

   ^21But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto
   the Lord, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the
   priest's.

   ^22And if a man sanctify unto the Lord a field which he hath bought,
   which is not of the fields of his possession;

   ^23Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation,
   even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in
   that day, as a holy thing unto the Lord.

   ^24In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it
   was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.

   ^25And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the
   sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.

   ^26Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the Lord'S
   firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is
   the Lord'S.

   ^27And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according
   to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it
   be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.

   ^28Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the
   Lord of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of
   his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most
   holy unto the Lord.

   ^29None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but
   shall surely be put to death.

   ^30And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or
   of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord'S: it is holy unto the Lord.

   ^31And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add
   thereto the fifth part thereof.

   ^32And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of
   whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the
   Lord.

   ^33He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he
   change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change
   thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

   ^34These are the commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses for the
   children of Israel in mount Sinai.

    Chapter 1

   And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the
   tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month,
   in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt,
   saying,

   ^2Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel,
   after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of
   their names, every male by their polls;

   ^3From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to
   war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies.

   ^4And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of
   the house of his fathers.

   ^5And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: of the
   tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur.

   ^6Of Simeon; Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

   ^17And Moses and Aaron took these men which are expressed by their
   names:

   ^18And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of
   the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their
   families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the
   names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.

   ^19As the Lord commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness
   of Sinai.

   ^20And the children of Reuben, Israel's eldest son, by their
   generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers,
   according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from
   twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;

   ^21Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Reuben, were
   forty and six thousand and five hundred.

   ^22Of the children of Simeon, by their generations, after their
   families, by the house of their fathers, those that were numbered of
   them, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male

   forty and five thousand six hundred and fifty.

   ^26Of the children of Judah, by their generations, after their
   families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the
   names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth
   to war;

   ^27Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Judah, were
   threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.

   ^28Of the children of Issachar, by their generations, after their
   families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the
   names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth
   to war;

   ^29Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Issachar,
   were fifty and four thousand and four hundred.

   ^30Of the children of Zebulun, by their generations, after their
   families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the
   names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth
   to war;

   ^31Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Zebulun, were
   fifty and seven thousand and four hundred.

   ^32Of the children of Joseph, namely, of the children of Ephraim, by
   their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers,
   according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward,
   all that were able to go forth to war;

   ^33Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Ephraim, were
   forty thousand and five hundred.

   ^34Of the children of Manasseh, by their generations, after their
   families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the
   names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth
   to war;

   ^35Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Manasseh,
   were thirty and two thousand and two hundred.

   ^36Of the children of Benjamin, by their generations, after their
   families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the
   names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth
   to war;

   ^37Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Benjamin,
   were thirty and five thousand and four hundred.

   ^38Of the children of Dan, by their generations, after their families,
   by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names,
   from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to
   war;

   ^39Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Dan, were
   threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.

   of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to
   go forth to war;

   ^43Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Naphtali,
   were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.

   ^44These are those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaron numbered,
   and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: each one was for the house
   of his fathers.

   ^45So were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel, by
   the house of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, all that
   were able to go forth to war in Israel;

   ^46Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three
   thousand and five hundred and fifty.

   ^47But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered
   among them.

   ^48For the Lord had spoken unto Moses, saying,

   ^49Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum
   of them among the children of Israel:

   ^50But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony,
   and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to
   it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and
   they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the
   tabernacle.

   ^51And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it
   down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set
   it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

   ^52And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his
   own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.

   ^53But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony,
   that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel:
   and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.

   ^54And the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord
   commanded Moses, so did they.

   hindmost with their standards.

   ^32These are those which were numbered of the children of Israel by the
   house of their fathers: all those that were numbered of the camps
   throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and
   five hundred and fifty.

   ^33But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as
   the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^34And the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord
   commanded Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so they set
   forward, every one after their families, according to the house of
   their fathers.

    Chapter 3

   These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the
   Lord spake with Moses in mount Sinai.

   ^2And these are the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the firstborn,
   and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

   ^3These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were
   anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office.

   ^4And Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord, when they offered strange
   fire before the Lord, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no
   children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office in
   the sight of Aaron their father.

   ^5And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^6Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the
   priest, that they may minister unto him.

   ^7And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole
   congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the
   service of the tabernacle.

   ^8And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the
   congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the
   service of the tabernacle.

   ^9And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they are
   wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.

   ^10And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on
   their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put
   to death.

   ^11And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^12And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of
   Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the
   children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine;

   ^13Because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I smote all
   the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn
   in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they be: I am the Lord.

   ^14And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,

   ^15Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by
   their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou
   number them.

   ^16And Moses numbered them according to the word of the Lord, as he was
   commanded.

   ^17And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and Kohath,
   and Merari.

   ^18And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families;
   Libni, and Shimei.

   ^19And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar, Hebron,
   and Uzziel.

   ^20And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi. These
   are the families of the Levites according to the house of their
   fathers.

   ^21Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of the
   Shimites: these are the families of the Gershonites.

   ^22Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the
   males, from a month old and upward, even those that were numbered of
   them were seven thousand and five hundred.

   ^23The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernacle
   westward.

   ^24And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites shall be
   Eliasaph the son of Lael.

   ^25And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the
   congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering
   thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation,

   ^26And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of the
   court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and
   the cords of it for all the service thereof.

   ^27And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family of the
   Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the
   Uzzielites: these are the families of the Kohathites.

   ^28In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were
   eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.

   ^29The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of the
   tabernacle southward.

   ^30And the chief of the house of the father of the families of the
   Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.

   ^31And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the
   candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith
   they minister, and the hanging, and all the service thereof.

   ^32And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over the
   chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that keep the
   charge of the sanctuary.

   ^33Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the
   Mushites: these are the families of Merari.

   ^34And those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all
   the males, from a month old and upward, were six thousand and two
   hundred.

   ^35And the chief of the house of the father of the families of Merari
   was Zuriel the son of Abihail: these shall pitch on the side of the
   tabernacle northward.

   ^36And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall be the
   boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars
   thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels thereof, and all
   that serveth thereto,

   ^37And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and
   their pins, and their cords.

   ^38But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, even
   before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall be Moses, and
   Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge
   of the children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be
   put to death.

   ^39All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron
   numbered at the commandment of the Lord, throughout their families, all
   the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand.

   ^40And the Lord said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males
   of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the
   number of their names.

   ^41And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the Lord) instead of
   all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the
   Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children
   of Israel.

   ^42And Moses numbered, as the Lord commanded him, all the firstborn
   among the children of Israel.

   ^43And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old
   and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two
   thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.

   ^44And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^45Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of
   Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the
   Levites shall be mine: I am the Lord.

   ^46And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and
   threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel,
   which are more than the Levites;

   ^47Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the
   shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel is twenty
   gerahs:)

   ^48And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is
   to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.

   ^49And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and above
   them that were redeemed by the Levites:

   ^50Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money; a
   thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels, after the
   shekel of the sanctuary:

   ^51And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and
   to his sons, according to the word of the Lord, as the Lord commanded
   Moses.

    Chapter 4

   And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

   ^2Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after
   their families, by the house of their fathers,

   ^3From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that
   enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the
   congregation.

   ^4This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of
   the congregation, about the most holy things:

   ^5And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons,
   and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover the ark of
   testimony with it:

   ^6And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and shall
   spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves
   thereof.

   ^7And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue,
   and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers
   to cover withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon:

   ^8And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the
   same with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in the staves
   thereof.

   ^9And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the
   light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all the
   oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it:

   ^10And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering
   of badgers' skins, and shall put it upon a bar.

   ^11And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and
   cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put to the staves
   thereof:

   ^12And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith they
   minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover
   them with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put them on a bar:

   ^13And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a
   purple cloth thereon:

   ^14And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they
   minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels,
   and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread
   upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and put to the staves of it.

   ^15And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the
   sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set
   forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they
   shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are the
   burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^16And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest pertaineth
   the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat
   offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the
   tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the
   vessels thereof.

   ^17And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

   ^18Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from
   among the Levites:

   ^19But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they
   approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and
   appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:

   ^20But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered,
   lest they die.

   ^21And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^22Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of
   their fathers, by their families;

   ^23From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou
   number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work
   in the tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^24This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve,
   and for burdens:

   ^25And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the
   tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the
   badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the hanging for the door of
   the tabernacle of the congregation,

   ^26And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the
   gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round
   about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and
   all that is made for them: so shall they serve.

   ^27At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of
   the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their
   service: and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens.

   ^28This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the
   tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be under the
   hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

   ^29As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their
   families, by the house of their fathers;

   ^30From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt
   thou number them, every one that entereth into the service, to do the
   work of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^31And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their
   service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of the
   tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets
   thereof,

   ^32And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and
   their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all
   their service: and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the
   charge of their burden.

   ^33This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according
   to all their service, in the tabernacle of the congregation, under the
   hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

   ^34And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered the
   sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the house of
   their fathers,

   ^35From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every
   one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of
   the congregation:

   ^36And those that were numbered of them by their families were two
   thousand seven hundred and fifty.

   ^37These were they that were numbered of the families of the
   Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the
   congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to the
   commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses.

   ^38And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, throughout
   their families, and by the house of their fathers,

   ^39From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every
   one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of
   the congregation,

   ^40Even those that were numbered of them, throughout their families, by
   the house of their fathers, were two thousand and six hundred and
   thirty.

   ^41These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of
   Gershon, of all that might do service in the tabernacle of the
   congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did number according to the
   commandment of the Lord.

   ^42And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari,
   throughout their families, by the house of their fathers,

   ^43From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every
   one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of
   the congregation,

   ^44Even those that were numbered of them after their families, were
   three thousand and two hundred.

   ^45These be those that were numbered of the families of the sons of
   Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the Lord
   by the hand of Moses.

   ^46All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron
   and the chief of Israel numbered, after their families, and after the
   house of their fathers,

   ^47From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every
   one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of the
   burden in the tabernacle of the congregation,

   ^48Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and five
   hundred and fourscore.

   ^49According to the commandment of the Lord they were numbered by the
   hand of Moses, every one according to his service, and according to his
   burden: thus were they numbered of him, as the Lord commanded Moses.

    Chapter 5

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every
   leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by
   the dead:

   ^3Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put
   them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.

   ^4And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp:
   as the Lord spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.

   ^5And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^6Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit
   any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the Lord, and that
   person be guilty;

   ^7Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall
   recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the
   fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath
   trespassed.

   ^8But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let
   the trespass be recompensed unto the Lord, even to the priest; beside
   the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him.

   ^9And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel,
   which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.

   ^10And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man
   giveth the priest, it shall be his.

   ^11And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^12Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's
   wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,

   ^13And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her
   husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness
   against her, neither she be taken with the manner;

   ^14And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his
   wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him,
   and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:

   ^15Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall
   bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal;
   he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is
   an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to
   remembrance.

   ^16And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the Lord:

   ^17And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of
   the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take,
   and put it into the water:

   ^18And the priest shall set the woman before the Lord, and uncover the
   woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is
   the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter
   water that causeth the curse:

   ^19And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman,
   If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to
   uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this
   bitter water that causeth the curse:

   ^20But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband, and
   if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee beside thine
   husband:

   ^21Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and
   the priest shall say unto the woman, The Lord make thee a curse and an
   oath among thy people, when the Lord doth make thy thigh to rot, and
   thy belly to swell;

   ^22And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to
   make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall say,
   Amen, amen.

   ^23And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot
   them out with the bitter water:

   ^24And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth
   the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her,
   and become bitter.

   ^25Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's
   hand, and shall wave the offering before the Lord, and offer it upon
   the altar:

   ^26And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the
   memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause
   the woman to drink the water.

   ^27And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to
   pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her
   husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her,
   and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot:
   and the woman shall be a curse among her people.

   ^28And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be
   free, and shall conceive seed.

   ^29This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another
   instead of her husband, and is defiled;

   ^30Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous
   over his wife, and shall set the woman before the Lord, and the priest
   shall execute upon her all this law.

   ^31Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall
   bear her iniquity.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 6

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man
   or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to
   separate themselves unto the Lord:

   ^3He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink
   no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink
   any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.

   ^4All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of
   the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.

   ^5All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come
   upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth
   himself unto the Lord, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the
   hair of his head grow.

   ^6All the days that he separateth himself unto the Lord he shall come
   at no dead body.

   ^7He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother,
   for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the
   consecration of his God is upon his head.

   ^8All the days of his separation he is holy unto the Lord.

   ^9And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head
   of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his
   cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.

   ^10And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young
   pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation:

   ^11And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other
   for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned
   by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.

   ^12And he shall consecrate unto the Lord the days of his separation,
   and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but
   the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was
   defiled.

   ^13And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation
   are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of
   the congregation:

   ^14And he shall offer his offering unto the Lord, one he lamb of the
   first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of
   the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without
   blemish for peace offerings,

   ^15And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with
   oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat
   offering, and their drink offerings.

   ^16And the priest shall bring them before the Lord, and shall offer his
   sin offering, and his burnt offering:

   ^17And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto
   the Lord, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer
   also his meat offering, and his drink offering.

   ^18And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door
   of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the
   head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the
   sacrifice of the peace offerings.

   ^19And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one
   unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall
   put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his
   separation is shaven:

   ^20And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the Lord:
   this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder:
   and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.

   ^21This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering
   unto the Lord for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get:
   according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his
   separation.

   ^22And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^23Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall
   bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,

   ^24The Lord bless thee, and keep thee:

   ^25The Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee:

   ^26The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.

   ^27And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will
   bless them.

    Chapter 7

   And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the
   tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the
   instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and
   had anointed them, and sanctified them;

   ^2That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who
   were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered,
   offered:

   ^3And they brought their offering before the Lord, six covered wagons,
   and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an
   ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle.

   ^4And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^5Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle
   of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to
   every man according to his service.

   ^6And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the
   Levites.

   ^7Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according
   to their service:

   ^8And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari,
   according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of
   Aaron the priest.

   ^9But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the
   sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their
   shoulders.

   ^10And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that
   it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the
   altar.

   ^11And the Lord said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering, each
   prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.

   ^12And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son
   of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah:

   ^13And his offering was one silver charger, the weight thereof was an
   hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after
   the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them were full of fine flour

    Chapter 8

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the
   seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.

   ^3And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the
   candlestick, as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^4And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the shaft
   thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according unto the
   pattern which the Lord had shewed Moses, so he made the candlestick.

   ^5And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^6Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.

   ^7And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of
   purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them
   wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean.

   ^8Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine
   flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a
   sin offering.

   ^9And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the
   congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children
   of Israel together:

   ^10And thou shalt bring the Levites before the Lord: and the children
   of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:

   ^11And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the Lord for an offering of
   the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the Lord.

   ^12And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the
   bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the
   other for a burnt offering, unto the Lord, to make an atonement for the
   Levites.

   ^13And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons,
   and offer them for an offering unto the Lord.

   ^14Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of
   Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.

   ^15And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the
   tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer
   them for an offering.

   ^16For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel;
   instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of
   all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.

   ^17For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man
   and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt
   I sanctified them for myself.

   ^18And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children
   of Israel.

   ^19And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from
   among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of
   Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement
   for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children
   of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.

   ^20And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of
   Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the Lord commanded
   Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.

   ^21And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and
   Aaron offered them as an offering before the Lord; and Aaron made an
   atonement for them to cleanse them.

   ^22And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the
   tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as
   the Lord had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto
   them.

   ^23And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^24This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five
   years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the
   tabernacle of the congregation:

   ^25And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the
   service thereof, and shall serve no more:

   ^26But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the
   congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt
   thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.

    Chapter 9

   And the Lord spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first
   month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt,
   saying,

   ^2Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed
   season.

   ^3In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his
   appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to
   all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.

   ^4And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep
   the passover.

   ^5And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month
   at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the Lord
   commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.

   ^6And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a
   man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came
   before Moses and before Aaron on that day:

   ^7And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a
   man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of
   the Lord in his appointed season among the children of Israel?

   ^8And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the Lord
   will command concerning you.

   ^9And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^10Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of
   your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a
   journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the Lord.

   ^11The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it,
   and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

   ^12They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of
   it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.

   ^13But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth
   to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among
   his people: because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his
   appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.

   ^14And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the
   passover unto the Lord; according to the ordinance of the passover, and
   according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one
   ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the
   land.

   ^15And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered
   the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there
   was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the
   morning.

   ^16So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of
   fire by night.

   ^17And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that
   the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud
   abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.

   ^18At the commandment of the Lord the children of Israel journeyed, and
   at the commandment of the Lord they pitched: as long as the cloud abode
   upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.

   ^19And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then
   the children of Israel kept the charge of the Lord, and journeyed not.

   ^20And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle;
   according to the commandment of the Lord they abode in their tents, and
   according to the commandment of the Lord they journeyed.

   ^21And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and
   that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed:
   whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they
   journeyed.

   ^22Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud
   tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel
   abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they
   journeyed.

   ^23At the commandment of the Lord they rested in the tents, and at the
   commandment of the Lord they journeyed: they kept the charge of the
   Lord, at the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 10

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make
   them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and
   for the journeying of the camps.

   ^3And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble
   themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^4And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are
   heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.

   ^5When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts
   shall go forward.

   ^6When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the
   south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their
   journeys.

   ^7But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow,
   but ye shall not sound an alarm.

   ^8And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and
   they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your
   generations.

   ^9And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth
   you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be
   remembered before the Lord your God, and ye shall be saved from your
   enemies.

   ^10Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in
   the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over
   your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings;
   that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the Lord
   your God.

   ^11And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the
   second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the
   testimony.

   ^12And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness
   of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.

   ^13And they first took their journey according to the commandment of
   the Lord by the hand of Moses.

   ^14In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of
   Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son
   of Amminadab.

   ^15And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was
   Nethaneel the son of Zuar.

   ^16And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab
   the son of Helon.

   ^17And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the
   sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.

   ^18And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to
   their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.

   ^19And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was
   Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

   ^20And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph
   the son of Deuel.

   ^21And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other
   did set up the tabernacle against they came.

   ^22And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward
   according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the son of
   Ammihud.

   ^23And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was
   Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

   ^24And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was
   Abidan the son of Gideoni.

   ^25And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward,
   which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and
   over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

   ^26And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel
   the son of Ocran.

   ^27And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira
   the son of Enan.

   ^28Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to
   their armies, when they set forward.

   ^29And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses'
   father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the Lord said,
   I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for
   the Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel.

   ^30And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own
   land, and to my kindred.

   ^31And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest
   how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us
   instead of eyes.

   ^32And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what
   goodness the Lord shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.

   ^33And they departed from the mount of the Lord three days' journey:
   and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them in the three
   days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.

   ^34And the cloud of the Lord was upon them by day, when they went out
   of the camp.

   ^35And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise
   up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate
   thee flee before thee.

   ^36And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto the many thousands
   of Israel.

    Chapter 11

   And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord: and the Lord
   heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the Lord burnt
   among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the
   camp.

   ^2And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the Lord,
   the fire was quenched.

   ^3And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the
   Lord burnt among them.

   ^4And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the
   children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh
   to eat?

   ^5We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the
   cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the
   garlick:

   ^6But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this
   manna, before our eyes.

   ^7And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the
   colour of bdellium.

   ^8And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills,
   or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and
   the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

   ^9And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon
   it.

   ^10Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every
   man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the Lord was kindled
   greatly; Moses also was displeased.

   ^11And Moses said unto the Lord, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy
   servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou
   layest the burden of all this people upon me?

   ^12Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou
   shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father
   beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their
   fathers?

   ^13Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they
   weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

   ^14I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy
   for me.

   ^15And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if
   I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.

   ^16And the Lord said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the
   elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and
   officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the
   congregation, that they may stand there with thee.

   ^17And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of
   the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they
   shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not
   thyself alone.

   ^18And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow,
   and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the Lord,
   saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in
   Egypt: therefore the Lord will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.

   ^19Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten
   days, nor twenty days;

   ^20But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it
   be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the Lord which is
   among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of
   Egypt?

   ^21And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred
   thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they
   may eat a whole month.

   ^22Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them?
   or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to
   suffice them?

   ^23And the Lord said unto Moses, Is the Lord's hand waxed short? thou
   shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.

   ^24And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the Lord, and
   gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them
   round about the tabernacle.

   ^25And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of
   the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and
   it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they
   prophesied, and did not cease.

   ^26But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one
   was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon
   them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto
   the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.

   ^27And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad
   do prophesy in the camp.

   ^28And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young
   men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.

   ^29And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that
   all the Lord'S people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his
   spirit upon them!

   ^30And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.

   ^31And there went forth a wind from the Lord, and brought quails from
   the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on
   this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round
   about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the
   earth.

   ^32And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all
   the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least
   gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves
   round about the camp.

   ^33And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed,
   the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord
   smote the people with a very great plague.

   ^34And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there
   they buried the people that lusted.

   ^35And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and
   abode at Hazeroth.

    Chapter 12

   And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman
   whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.

   ^2And they said, Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not
   spoken also by us? And the Lord heard it.

   ^3(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon
   the face of the earth.)

   ^4And the Lord spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto
   Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And
   they three came out.

   ^5And the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the
   door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came
   forth.

   ^6And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I
   the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak
   unto him in a dream.

   ^7My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.

   ^8With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in
   dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold:
   wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?

   ^9And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them; and he departed.

   ^10And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam
   became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and,
   behold, she was leprous.

   ^11And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not
   the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have
   sinned.

   ^12Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when
   he cometh out of his mother's womb.

   ^13And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, Heal her now, O God, I
   beseech thee.

   ^14And the Lord said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her
   face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from
   the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.

   ^15And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people
   journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.

   ^16And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the
   wilderness of Paran.

    Chapter 13

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give
   unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye
   send a man, every one a ruler among them.

   ^3And Moses by the commandment of the Lord sent them from the
   wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of
   Israel.

   ^4And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son
   of Zaccur.

   ^5Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

   ^6Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

   ^7Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.

   ^8Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.

   ^9Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.

   ^10Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.

   ^11Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the
   son of Susi.

   ^12Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.

   ^13Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.

   ^14Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.

   ^15Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

   ^16These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land.
   And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.

   ^17And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto
   them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:

   ^18And see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein,
   whether they be strong or weak, few or many;

   ^19And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad;
   and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in
   strong holds;

   ^20And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be
   wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit
   of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes.

   ^21So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin
   unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.

   ^22And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman,
   Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built
   seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)

   ^23And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a
   branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a
   staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.

   ^24The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of
   grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.

   ^25And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.

   ^26And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the
   congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran,
   to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the
   congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.

   ^27And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou
   sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the
   fruit of it.

   ^28Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the
   cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of
   Anak there.

   ^29The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and
   the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the
   Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.

   ^30And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at
   once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.

   ^31But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up
   against the people; for they are stronger than we.

   ^32And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had
   searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which
   we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
   thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great
   stature.

   ^33And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the
   giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in
   their sight.

    Chapter 14

   And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the
   people wept that night.

   ^2And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against
   Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had
   died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!

   ^3And wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land, to fall by the
   sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not
   better for us to return into Egypt?

   ^4And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us
   return into Egypt.

   ^5Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of
   the congregation of the children of Israel.

   ^6And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were
   of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:

   ^7And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel,
   saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding
   good land.

   ^8If the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and
   give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.

   ^9Only rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye the people of the
   land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them,
   and the Lord is with us: fear them not.

   ^10But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory
   of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all
   the children of Israel.

   ^11And the Lord said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me?
   and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I
   have shewed among them?

   ^12I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will
   make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.

   ^13And Moses said unto the Lord, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for
   thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)

   ^14And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have
   heard that thou Lord art among this people, that thou Lord art seen
   face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou
   goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar
   of fire by night.

   ^15Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations
   which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,

   ^16Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land
   which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the
   wilderness.

   ^17And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great,
   according as thou hast spoken, saying,

   ^18The Lord is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity
   and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the
   iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
   generation.

   ^19Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto
   the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from
   Egypt even until now.

   ^20And the Lord said, I have pardoned according to thy word:

   ^21But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory
   of the Lord.

   ^22Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles,
   which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now
   these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;

   ^23Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers,
   neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:

   ^24But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and
   hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he
   went; and his seed shall possess it.

   ^25(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To
   morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red
   sea.

   ^26And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

   ^27How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur
   against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel,
   which they murmur against me.

   ^28Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the Lord, as ye have spoken
   in mine ears, so will I do to you:

   ^29Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were
   numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old
   and upward, which have murmured against me,

   ^30Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware
   to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua
   the son of Nun.

   ^31But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I
   bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.

   ^32But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness.

   ^33And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and
   bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.

   ^34After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even
   forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even
   forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.

   ^35I the Lord have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil
   congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness
   they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.

   ^36And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and
   made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a
   slander upon the land,

   ^37Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died
   by the plague before the Lord.

   ^38But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which
   were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.

   ^39And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and
   the people mourned greatly.

   ^40And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top
   of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place
   which the Lord hath promised: for we have sinned.

   ^41And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of
   the Lord? but it shall not prosper.

   ^42Go not up, for the Lord is not among you; that ye be not smitten
   before your enemies.

   ^43For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye
   shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the Lord,
   therefore the Lord will not be with you.

   ^44But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark
   of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.

   ^45Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in
   that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.

    Chapter 15

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come
   into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you,

   ^3And will make an offering by fire unto the Lord, a burnt offering, or
   a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your
   solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the Lord, of the herd, or of
   the flock:

   ^4Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the Lord bring a meat
   offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an
   hin of oil.

   ^5And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou
   prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.

   ^6Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals
   of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.

   ^7And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of
   wine, for a sweet savour unto the Lord.

   ^8And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a
   sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the Lord:

   ^9Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth
   deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.

   ^10And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for
   an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.

   ^11Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a
   lamb, or a kid.

   ^12According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to
   every one according to their number.

   ^13All that are born of the country shall do these things after this
   manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto
   the Lord.

   ^14And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in
   your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet
   savour unto the Lord; as ye do, so he shall do.

   ^15One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also
   for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in
   your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord.

   ^16One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that
   sojourneth with you.

   ^17And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^18Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come
   into the land whither I bring you,

   ^19Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye
   shall offer up an heave offering unto the Lord.

   ^20Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave
   offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall
   ye heave it.

   ^21Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the Lord an heave
   offering in your generations.

   ^22And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which
   the Lord hath spoken unto Moses,

   ^23Even all that the Lord hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from
   the day that the Lord commanded Moses, and henceforward among your
   generations;

   ^24Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the
   knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer
   one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the
   Lord, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the
   manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.

   ^25And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of
   the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is
   ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by
   fire unto the Lord, and their sin offering before the Lord, for their
   ignorance:

   ^26And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of
   Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the
   people were in ignorance.

   ^27And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she
   goat of the first year for a sin offering.

   ^28And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth
   ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the Lord, to make an
   atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.

   ^29Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both
   for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger
   that sojourneth among them.

   ^30But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in
   the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the Lord; and that soul
   shall be cut off from among his people.

   ^31Because he hath despised the word of the Lord, and hath broken his
   commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be
   upon him.

   ^32And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found
   a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.

   ^33And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and
   Aaron, and unto all the congregation.

   ^34And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be
   done to him.

   ^35And the Lord said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death:
   all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.

   ^36And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned
   him with stones, and he died; as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^37And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^38Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them
   fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations,
   and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue:

   ^39And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and
   remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye
   seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to
   go a whoring:

   ^40That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto
   your God.

   ^41I am the Lord your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt,
   to be your God: I am the Lord your God.

    Chapter 16

   Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and
   Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons
   of Reuben, took men:

   ^2And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of
   Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the
   congregation, men of renown:

   ^3And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against
   Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the
   congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them:
   wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the
   Lord?

   ^4And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:

   ^5And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to
   morrow the Lord will shew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause
   him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause
   to come near unto him.

   ^6This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;

   ^7And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the Lord to
   morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the Lord doth choose, he
   shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.

   ^8And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:

   ^9Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath
   separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to
   himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand
   before the congregation to minister unto them?

   ^10And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons
   of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?

   ^11For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together
   against the Lord: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?

   ^12And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which
   said, We will not come up:

   ^13Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that
   floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou
   make thyself altogether a prince over us?

   ^14Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk
   and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou
   put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.

   ^15And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the Lord, Respect not thou
   their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt
   one of them.

   ^16And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the
   Lord, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:

   ^17And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye
   before the Lord every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers;
   thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.

   ^18And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid
   incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation with Moses and Aaron.

   ^19And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door
   of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the Lord
   appeared unto all the congregation.

   ^20And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

   ^21Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume
   them in a moment.

   ^22And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the
   spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with
   all the congregation?

   ^23And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^24Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the
   tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

   ^25And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of
   Israel followed him.

   ^26And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from
   the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be
   consumed in all their sins.

   ^27So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on
   every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of
   their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little
   children.

   ^28And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the Lord hath sent me to
   do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.

   ^29If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited
   after the visitation of all men; then the Lord hath not sent me.

   ^30But if the Lord make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and
   swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down
   quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have
   provoked the Lord.

   ^31And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these
   words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:

   ^32And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their
   houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their
   goods.

   ^33They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the
   pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the
   congregation.

   ^34And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them:
   for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.

   ^35And there came out a fire from the Lord, and consumed the two
   hundred and fifty men that offered incense.

   ^36And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^37Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the
   censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they
   are hallowed.

   ^38The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make
   them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them
   before the Lord, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign
   unto the children of Israel.

   ^39And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that
   were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering
   of the altar:

   ^40To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger,
   which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before
   the Lord; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the Lord said
   to him by the hand of Moses.

   ^41But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel
   murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the
   people of the Lord.

   ^42And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against
   Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the
   congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the
   Lord appeared.

   ^43And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^44And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^45Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as
   in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.

   ^46And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from
   off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the
   congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone
   out from the Lord; the plague is begun.

   ^47And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the
   congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and
   he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.

   ^48And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was
   stayed.

   ^49Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven
   hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.

   ^50And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation: and the plague was stayed.

    Chapter 17

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a
   rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes
   according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every
   man's name upon his rod.

   ^3And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod
   shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.

   ^4And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation
   before the testimony, where I will meet with you.

   ^5And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose,
   shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the
   children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.

   ^6And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their
   princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their
   fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their
   rods.

   ^7And Moses laid up the rods before the Lord in the tabernacle of
   witness.

   ^8And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the
   tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of
   Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and
   yielded almonds.

   ^9And Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord unto all the
   children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.

   ^10And the Lord said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the
   testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt
   quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.

   ^11And Moses did so: as the Lord commanded him, so did he.

   ^12And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die,
   we perish, we all perish.

   ^13Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the Lord
   shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

    Chapter 18

   And the Lord said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house
   with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy
   sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.

   ^2And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father,
   bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister
   unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the
   tabernacle of witness.

   ^3And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle:
   only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the
   altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.

   ^4And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the
   tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle:
   and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.

   ^5And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the
   altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.

   ^6And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the
   children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the Lord, to do
   the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^7Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office
   for every thing of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve:
   I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift: and
   the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

   ^8And the Lord spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the
   charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the
   children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the
   anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.

   ^9This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire:
   every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin
   offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they
   shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.

   ^10In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it:
   it shall be holy unto thee.

   ^11And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the
   wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee,
   and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever:
   every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.

   ^12All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the
   wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the Lord,
   them have I given thee.

   ^13And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring
   unto the Lord, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house
   shall eat of it.

   ^14Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.

   ^15Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring
   unto the Lord, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine:
   nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the
   firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.

   ^16And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou
   redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels,
   after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.

   ^17But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the
   firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt
   sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an
   offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the Lord.

   ^18And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the
   right shoulder are thine.

   ^19All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of
   Israel offer unto the Lord, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy
   daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt
   for ever before the Lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee.

   ^20And the Lord spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in
   their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part
   and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.

   ^21And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in
   Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the
   service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^22Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the
   tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.

   ^23But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the
   congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute
   for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel
   they have no inheritance.

   ^24But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an
   heave offering unto the Lord, I have given to the Levites to inherit:
   therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they
   shall have no inheritance.

   ^25And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^26Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the
   children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your
   inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the
   Lord, even a tenth part of the tithe.

   ^27And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though
   it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the
   winepress.

   ^28Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the Lord of all your
   tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give
   thereof the Lord'S heave offering to Aaron the priest.

   ^29Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the
   Lord, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of
   it.

   ^30Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best
   thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the
   increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.

   ^31And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it
   is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^32And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from
   it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the
   children of Israel, lest ye die.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 19

   And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

   ^2This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath commanded,
   saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red
   heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came
   yoke:

   ^3And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her
   forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:

   ^4And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and
   sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the
   congregation seven times:

   ^5And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh,
   and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:

   ^6And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and
   cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

   ^7Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh
   in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest
   shall be unclean until the even.

   ^8And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe
   his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.

   ^9And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and
   lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for
   the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation:
   it is a purification for sin.

   ^10And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his
   clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the
   children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them,
   for a statute for ever.

   ^11He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven
   days.

   ^12He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh
   day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then
   the seventh day he shall not be clean.

   ^13Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and
   purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the Lord; and that
   soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was
   not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet
   upon him.

   ^14This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the
   tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.

   ^15And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is
   unclean.

   ^16And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open
   fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be
   unclean seven days.

   ^17And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt
   heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto
   in a vessel:

   ^18And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and
   sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the
   persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one
   slain, or one dead, or a grave:

   ^19And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third
   day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify
   himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be
   clean at even.

   ^20But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself,
   that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath
   defiled the sanctuary of the Lord: the water of separation hath not
   been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.

   ^21And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that
   sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that
   toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.

   ^22And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the
   soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.

    Chapter 20

   Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the
   desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and
   Miriam died there, and was buried there.

   ^2And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered
   themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.

   ^3And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we
   had died when our brethren died before the Lord!

   ^4And why have ye brought up the congregation of the Lord into this
   wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?

   ^5And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in
   unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines,
   or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.

   ^6And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the
   door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their
   faces: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them.

   ^7And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^8Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron
   thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall
   give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of
   the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.

   ^9And Moses took the rod from before the Lord, as he commanded him.

   ^10And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the
   rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you
   water out of this rock?

   ^11And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock
   twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank,
   and their beasts also.

   ^12And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not,
   to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye
   shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given
   them.

   ^13This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove
   with the Lord, and he was sanctified in them.

   ^14And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus
   saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath
   befallen us:

   ^15How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a
   long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers:

   ^16And when we cried unto the Lord, he heard our voice, and sent an
   angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in
   Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:

   ^17Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass
   through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of
   the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not
   turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy
   borders.

   ^18And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out
   against thee with the sword.

   ^19And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high
   way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it:
   I will only, without doing any thing else, go through on my feet.

   ^20And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against
   him with much people, and with a strong hand.

   ^21Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:
   wherefore Israel turned away from him.

   ^22And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed
   from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.

   ^23And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast
   of the land of Edom, saying,

   ^24Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into
   the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye
   rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.

   ^25Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor:

   ^26And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son:
   and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.

   ^27And Moses did as the Lord commanded: and they went up into mount Hor
   in the sight of all the congregation.

   ^28And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar
   his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and
   Eleazar came down from the mount.

   ^29And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned
   for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 21

   And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell
   that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against
   Israel, and took some of them prisoners.

   ^2And Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou wilt indeed
   deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their
   cities.

   ^3And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the
   Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he
   called the name of the place Hormah.

   ^4And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to
   compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much
   discouraged because of the way.

   ^5And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have
   ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no
   bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light
   bread.

   ^6And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the
   people; and much people of Israel died.

   ^7Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we
   have spoken against the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the Lord,
   that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the
   people.

   ^8And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it
   upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten,
   when he looketh upon it, shall live.

   ^9And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it
   came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the
   serpent of brass, he lived.

   ^10And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.

   ^11And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the
   wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.

   ^12From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.

   ^13From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon,
   which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the
   Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the
   Amorites.

   ^14Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord, What he
   did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,

   ^15And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of
   Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.

   ^16And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the Lord
   spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them
   water.

   ^17Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:

   ^18The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by
   the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the
   wilderness they went to Mattanah:

   ^19And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:

   ^20And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to
   the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.

   ^21And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,

   ^22Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or
   into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we
   will go along by the king's high way, until we be past thy borders.

   ^23And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but
   Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel
   into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.

   ^24And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his
   land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the
   border of the children of Ammon was strong.

   ^25And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities
   of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.

   ^26For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had
   fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of
   his hand, even unto Arnon.

   ^27Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let
   the city of Sihon be built and prepared:

   ^28For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of
   Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of
   Arnon.

   ^29Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath
   given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto
   Sihon king of the Amorites.

   ^30We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we
   have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.

   ^31Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

   ^32And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages
   thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.

   ^33And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of
   Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at
   Edrei.

   ^34And the Lord said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him
   into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to
   him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at
   Heshbon.

   ^35So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was
   none left him alive: and they possessed his land.

    Chapter 22

   And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of
   Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.

   ^2And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the
   Amorites.

   ^3And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and
   Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.

   ^4And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick
   up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the
   field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that
   time.

   ^5He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor,
   which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to
   call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt:
   behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against
   me:

   ^6Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are
   too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite
   them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom
   thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.

   ^7And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the
   rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and
   spake unto him the words of Balak.

   ^8And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you
   word again, as the Lord shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab
   abode with Balaam.

   ^9And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?

   ^10And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,
   hath sent unto me, saying,

   ^11Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face
   of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to
   overcome them, and drive them out.

   ^12And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt
   not curse the people: for they are blessed.

   ^13And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of
   Balak, Get you into your land: for the Lord refuseth to give me leave
   to go with you.

   ^14And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said,
   Balaam refuseth to come with us.

   ^15And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than
   they.

   ^16And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son
   of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:

   ^17For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do
   whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me
   this people.

   ^18And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak
   would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the
   word of the Lord my God, to do less or more.

   ^19Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may
   know what the Lord will say unto me more.

   ^20And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men
   come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I
   shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.

   ^21And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went
   with the princes of Moab.

   ^22And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the
   Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding
   upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.

   ^23And the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, and his
   sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and
   went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the
   way.

   ^24But the angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall
   being on this side, and a wall on that side.

   ^25And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she thrust herself unto
   the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her
   again.

   ^26And the angel of the Lord went further, and stood in a narrow place,
   where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.

   ^27And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she fell down under
   Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a
   staff.

   ^28And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam,
   What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three
   times?

   ^29And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would
   there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.

   ^30And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou
   hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do
   so unto thee? And he said, Nay.

   ^31Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the
   Lord standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed
   down his head, and fell flat on his face.

   ^32And the angel of the Lord said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten
   thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee,
   because thy way is perverse before me:

   ^33And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she
   had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her
   alive.

   ^34And Balaam said unto the angel of the Lord, I have sinned; for I
   knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it
   displease thee, I will get me back again.

   ^35And the angel of the Lord said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but
   only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So
   Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

   ^36And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him
   unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the
   utmost coast.

   ^37And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to
   call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to
   promote thee to honour?

   ^38And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any
   power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth,
   that shall I speak.

   ^39And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.

   ^40And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the
   princes that were with him.

   ^41And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and
   brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see
   the utmost part of the people.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 23

   And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me
   here seven oxen and seven rams.

   ^2And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on
   every altar a bullock and a ram.

   ^3And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will
   go: peradventure the Lord will come to meet me: and whatsoever he
   sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.

   ^4And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven
   altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.

   ^5And the Lord put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto
   Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.

   ^6And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice,
   he, and all the princes of Moab.

   ^7And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath
   brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come,
   curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.

   ^8How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy,
   whom the Lord hath not defied?

   ^9For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold
   him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among
   the nations.

   ^10Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part
   of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end
   be like his!

   ^11And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee
   to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.

   ^12And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which
   the Lord hath put in my mouth?

   ^13And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another
   place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost
   part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from
   thence.

   ^14And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah,
   and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.

   ^15And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I
   meet the Lord yonder.

   ^16And the Lord met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go
   again unto Balak, and say thus.

   ^17And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and
   the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the
   Lord spoken?

   ^18And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear;
   hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:

   ^19God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that
   he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he
   spoken, and shall he not make it good?

   ^20Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed;
   and I cannot reverse it.

   ^21He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen
   perverseness in Israel: the Lord his God is with him, and the shout of
   a king is among them.

   ^22God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an
   unicorn.

   ^23Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any
   divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of
   Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!

   ^24Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up
   himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the
   prey, and drink the blood of the slain.

   ^25And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless
   them at all.

   ^26But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying,
   All that the Lord speaketh, that I must do?

   ^27And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee
   unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest
   curse me them from thence.

   ^28And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward
   Jeshimon.

   ^29And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare
   me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

   ^30And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on
   every altar.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 24

   And when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he went
   not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face
   toward the wilderness.

   ^2And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents
   according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.

   ^3And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath
   said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

   ^4He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of
   the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:

   ^5How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!

   ^6As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side,
   as the trees of lign aloes which the Lord hath planted, and as cedar
   trees beside the waters.

   ^7He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in
   many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom
   shall be exalted.

   ^8God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength
   of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break
   their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.

   ^9He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall
   stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that
   curseth thee.

   ^10And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands
   together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine
   enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three
   times.

   ^11Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto
   great honour; but, lo, the Lord hath kept thee back from honour.

   ^12And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which
   thou sentest unto me, saying,

   ^13If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot
   go beyond the commandment of the Lord, to do either good or bad of mine
   own mind; but what the Lord saith, that will I speak?

   ^14And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will
   advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter
   days.

   ^15And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath
   said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

   ^16He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge
   of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a
   trance, but having his eyes open:

   ^17I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh:
   there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of
   Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the
   children of Sheth.

   ^18And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for
   his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.

   ^19Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall
   destroy him that remaineth of the city.

   ^20And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said,
   Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that
   he perish for ever.

   ^21And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said,
   Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.

   ^22Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry
   thee away captive.

   ^23And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God
   doeth this!

   ^24And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict
   Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.

   ^25And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak
   also went his way.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 25

   And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom
   with the daughters of Moab.

   ^2And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the
   people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.

   ^3And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the Lord
   was kindled against Israel.

   ^4And the Lord said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and
   hang them up before the Lord against the sun, that the fierce anger of
   the Lord may be turned away from Israel.

   ^5And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men
   that were joined unto Baalpeor.

   ^6And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his
   brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of
   all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before
   the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^7And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
   saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in
   his hand;

   ^8And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of
   them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So
   the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.

   ^9And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.

   ^10And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^11Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath
   turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous
   for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in
   my jealousy.

   ^12Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:

   ^13And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of
   an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made
   an atonement for the children of Israel.

   ^14Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain
   with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a
   chief house among the Simeonites.

   ^15And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the
   daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in
   Midian.

   ^16And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^17Vex the Midianites, and smite them:

   ^18For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you
   in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a
   prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the
   plague for Peor's sake.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 26

   And it came to pass after the plague, that the Lord spake unto Moses
   and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,

   ^2Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from
   twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that
   are able to go to war in Israel.

   ^3And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of
   Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,

   ^4Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as the
   Lord commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which went forth out

   ^53Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to
   the number of names.

   ^54To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou shalt
   give the less inheritance: to every one shall his inheritance be given
   according to those that were numbered of him.

   ^55Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to the
   names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.

   ^56According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided between
   many and few.

   ^57And these are they that were numbered of the Levites after their

   among the children of Israel.

   ^63These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest,
   who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan
   near Jericho.

   ^64But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the
   priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the
   wilderness of Sinai.

   ^65For the Lord had said of them, They shall surely die in the
   wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of
   Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 27

   Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of
   Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of
   Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters;
   Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.

   ^2And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and
   before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

   ^3Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of
   them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company
   of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons.

   ^4Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family,
   because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the
   brethren of our father.

   ^5And Moses brought their cause before the Lord.

   ^6And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^7The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them
   a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou
   shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.

   ^8And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man
   die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto
   his daughter.

   ^9And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto
   his brethren.

   ^10And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto
   his father's brethren.

   ^11And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his
   inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he
   shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute
   of judgment, as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^12And the Lord said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim,
   and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel.

   ^13And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy
   people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.

   ^14For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the
   strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their
   eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.

   ^15And Moses spake unto the Lord, saying,

   ^16Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over
   the congregation,

   ^17Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and
   which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the
   congregation of the Lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd.

   ^18And the Lord said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man
   in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;

   ^19And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the
   congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.

   ^20And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the
   congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.

   ^21And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel
   for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord: at his word shall
   they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the
   children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.

   ^22And Moses did as the Lord commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set
   him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:

   ^23And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the Lord
   commanded by the hand of Moses.

    Chapter 28

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and
   my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me,
   shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.

   ^3And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which
   ye shall offer unto the Lord; two lambs of the first year without spot
   day by day, for a continual burnt offering.

   ^4The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb
   shalt thou offer at even;

   ^5And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled
   with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.

   ^6It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai
   for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord.

   ^7And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for
   the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be
   poured unto the Lord for a drink offering.

   ^8And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of
   the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, a
   sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord.

   ^9And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and
   two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the
   drink offering thereof:

   ^10This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual
   burnt offering, and his drink offering.

   ^11And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering
   unto the Lord; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the

   oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering,
   mingled with oil, for one ram;

   ^13And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat
   offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a
   sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord.

   ^14And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a
   bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of
   an hin unto a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month
   throughout the months of the year.

   ^15And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the Lord shall be
   offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

   ^16And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of the
   Lord.

   ^17And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days
   shall unleavened bread be eaten.

   ^18In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner
   of servile work therein:

   ^19But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering
   unto the Lord; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the
   first year: they shall be unto you without blemish:

   ^20And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three
   tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a
   ram;

   ^21A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb, throughout the
   seven lambs:

   ^22And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.

   ^23Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which
   is for a continual burnt offering.

   ^24After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven days,
   the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the
   Lord: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and his
   drink offering.

   ^25And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall
   do no servile work.

   ^26Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat
   offering unto the Lord, after your weeks be out, ye shall have an holy
   convocation; ye shall do no servile work:

   ^27But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the
   Lord; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year;

   ^28And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals
   unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram,

   offerings.

   ^40And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the Lord
   commanded Moses.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 30

   And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of
   Israel, saying, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded.

   ^2If a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or swear an oath to bind his soul
   with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all
   that proceedeth out of his mouth.

   ^3If a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself by a bond,
   being in her father's house in her youth;

   ^4And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound
   her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows
   shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall
   stand.

   ^5But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of
   her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall
   stand: and the Lord shall forgive her, because her father disallowed
   her.

   ^6And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought
   out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;

   ^7And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that
   he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she
   bound her soul shall stand.

   ^8But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then
   he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with
   her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the Lord
   shall forgive her.

   ^9But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they
   have bound their souls, shall stand against her.

   ^10And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond
   with an oath;

   ^11And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed
   her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she
   bound her soul shall stand.

   ^12But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard
   them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or
   concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made
   them void; and the Lord shall forgive her.

   ^13Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband
   may establish it, or her husband may make it void.

   ^14But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day;
   then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon
   her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day
   that he heard them.

   ^15But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard
   them; then he shall bear her iniquity.

   ^16These are the statutes, which the Lord commanded Moses, between a
   man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her
   youth in her father's house.

    Chapter 31

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou
   be gathered unto thy people.

   ^3And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto
   the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the Lord of
   Midian.

   ^4Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall
   ye send to the war.

   ^5So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of
   every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.

   ^6And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and
   Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy
   instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.

   ^7And they warred against the Midianites, as the Lord commanded Moses;
   and they slew all the males.

   ^8And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were
   slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings
   of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.

   ^9And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and
   their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all
   their flocks, and all their goods.

   ^10And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their
   goodly castles, with fire.

   ^11And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of
   beasts.

   ^12And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto
   Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the
   children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by
   Jordan near Jericho.

   ^13And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the
   congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.

   ^14And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains
   over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.

   ^15And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?

   ^16Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of
   Balaam, to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor, and
   there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord.

   ^17Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every
   woman that hath known man by lying with him.

   ^18But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with
   him, keep alive for yourselves.

   ^19And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed
   any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both
   yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.

   ^20And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all
   work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.

   ^21And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the
   battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord commanded
   Moses;

   ^22Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the
   lead,

   ^23Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the
   fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the
   water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go
   through the water.

   ^24And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be
   clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.

   ^25And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^26Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast,
   thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the
   congregation:

   ^27And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war
   upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:

   ^28And levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to
   battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the
   beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:

   ^29Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an
   heave offering of the Lord.

   ^30And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of
   fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks,
   of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the
   charge of the tabernacle of the Lord.

   ^31And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^32And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had
   caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand
   sheep,

   ^33And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,

   ^34And threescore and one thousand asses,

   ^35And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not
   known man by lying with him.

   ^36And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war,
   was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and
   five hundred sheep:

   ^37And the Lord'S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore
   and fifteen.

   ^38And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the Lord'S
   tribute was threescore and twelve.

   ^39And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the
   Lord'S tribute was threescore and one.

   ^40And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the Lord'S tribute
   was thirty and two persons.

   ^41And Moses gave the tribute, which was the Lord'S heave offering,
   unto Eleazar the priest, as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^42And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the
   men that warred,

   ^43(Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred
   thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,

   ^44And thirty and six thousand beeves,

   ^45And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,

   ^46And sixteen thousand persons;)

   ^47Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of
   fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which
   kept the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord; as the Lord commanded
   Moses.

   ^48And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains
   of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:

   ^49And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men
   of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.

   ^50We have therefore brought an oblation for the Lord, what every man
   hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings,
   and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the Lord.

   ^51And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all
   wrought jewels.

   ^52And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the Lord,
   of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was
   sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.

   ^53(For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)

   ^54And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of
   thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the
   congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the
   Lord.

    Chapter 32

   Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great
   multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land
   of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;

   ^2The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto
   Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the
   congregation, saying,

   ^3Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh,
   and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,

   ^4Even the country which the Lord smote before the congregation of
   Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:

   ^5Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this
   land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over
   Jordan.

   ^6And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of
   Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?

   ^7And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from
   going over into the land which the Lord hath given them?

   ^8Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the
   land.

   ^9For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land,
   they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should
   not go into the land which the Lord had given them.

   ^10And the Lord'S anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,
   saying,

   ^11Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years
   old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto
   Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:

   ^12Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of
   Nun: for they have wholly followed the Lord.

   ^13And the Lord'S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them
   wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that
   had done evil in the sight of the Lord, was consumed.

   ^14And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of
   sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord toward Israel.

   ^15For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in
   the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.

   ^16And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here
   for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:

   ^17But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel,
   until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall
   dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.

   ^18We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel
   have inherited every man his inheritance.

   ^19For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward;
   because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.

   ^20And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go
   armed before the Lord to war,

   ^21And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the Lord, until he
   hath driven out his enemies from before him,

   ^22And the land be subdued before the Lord: then afterward ye shall
   return, and be guiltless before the Lord, and before Israel; and this
   land shall be your possession before the Lord.

   ^23But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the Lord:
   and be sure your sin will find you out.

   ^24Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and
   do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.

   ^25And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses,
   saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.

   ^26Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be
   there in the cities of Gilead:

   ^27But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the
   Lord to battle, as my lord saith.

   ^28So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
   the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of
   Israel:

   ^29And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of
   Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle,
   before the Lord, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye
   shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:

   ^30But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have
   possessions among you in the land of Canaan.

   ^31And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying,
   As the Lord hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.

   ^32We will pass over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan,
   that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.

   ^33And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the
   children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of
   Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of
   Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts,
   even the cities of the country round about.

   ^34And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,

   ^35And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,

   ^36And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.

   ^37And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and
   Kirjathaim,

   ^38And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah:
   and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.

   ^39And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and
   took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.

   ^40And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt
   therein.

   ^41And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof,
   and called them Havothjair.

   ^42And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called
   it Nobah, after his own name.

    Chapter 33

   These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth out
   of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and
   Aaron.

   ^2And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the
   commandment of the Lord: and these are their journeys according to
   their goings out.

   ^3And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth
   day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children
   of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.

   ^4For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the Lord had
   smitten among them: upon their gods also the Lord executed judgments.

   ^5And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in
   Succoth.

   ^6And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in the
   edge of the wilderness.

   ^7And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth, which
   is before Baalzephon: and they pitched before Migdol.

   ^8And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through the
   midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days' journey in
   the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.

   ^9And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were
   twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees; and they
   pitched there.

   ^10And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.

   ^11And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the wilderness of
   Sin.

   ^12And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and
   encamped in Dophkah.

   ^13And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.

   ^14And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where was no
   water for the people to drink.

   ^15And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness of
   Sinai.

   ^16And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at
   Kibrothhattaavah.

   ^17And they departed from Kibrothhattaavah, and encamped at Hazeroth.

   ^18And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah.

   ^19And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmonparez.

   ^20And they departed from Rimmonparez, and pitched in Libnah.

   ^21And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah.

   ^22And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah.

   ^23And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher.

   ^24And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah.

   ^25And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth.

   ^26And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.

   ^27And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah.

   ^28And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah.

   ^29And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah.

   ^30And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.

   ^31And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.

   ^32And they removed from Benejaakan, and encamped at Horhagidgad.

   ^33And they went from Horhagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah.

   ^34And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.

   ^35And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber.

   ^36And they removed from Eziongaber, and pitched in the wilderness of
   Zin, which is Kadesh.

   ^37And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge
   of the land of Edom.

   ^38And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of
   the Lord, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of
   Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first day of the
   fifth month.

   ^39And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died
   in mount Hor.

   ^40And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the land of
   Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.

   ^41And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah.

   ^42And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon.

   ^43And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth.

   ^44And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the
   border of Moab.

   ^45And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibongad.

   ^46And they removed from Dibongad, and encamped in Almondiblathaim.

   ^47And they removed from Almondiblathaim, and pitched in the mountains
   of Abarim, before Nebo.

   ^48And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the
   plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

   ^49And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto Abelshittim
   in the plains of Moab.

   ^50And the Lord spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near
   Jericho, saying,

   ^51Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are
   passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

   ^52Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before
   you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten
   images, and quite pluck down all their high places:

   ^53And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell
   therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.

   ^54And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your
   families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to
   the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance
   shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of
   your fathers ye shall inherit.

   ^55But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before
   you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them
   shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex
   you in the land wherein ye dwell.

   ^56Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I
   thought to do unto them.

    Chapter 34

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into
   the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an
   inheritance, even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:)

   ^3Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by
   the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of
   the salt sea eastward:

   ^4And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim,
   and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south
   to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:

   ^5And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of
   Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.

   ^6And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a
   border: this shall be your west border.

   ^7And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall
   point out for you mount Hor:

   ^8From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of
   Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:

   ^9And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall
   be at Hazar- enan: this shall be your north border.

   ^10And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham:

   ^11And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side
   of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of
   the sea of Chinnereth eastward:

   ^12And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it
   shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the coasts
   thereof round about.

   ^13And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land
   which ye shall inherit by lot, which the Lord commanded to give unto
   the nine tribes, and to the half tribe:

   ^14For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of
   their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the
   house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the
   tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance:

   ^15The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on
   this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.

   ^16And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^17These are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you:
   Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.

   ^18And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by
   inheritance.

   ^19And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the
   son of Jephunneh.

   ^20And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of
   Ammihud.

   ^21Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.

   ^22And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of
   Jogli.

   ^23The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children
   of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.

   ^24And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the
   son of Shiphtan.

   ^25And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan
   the son of Parnach.

   ^26And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the
   son of Azzan.

   ^27And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son
   of Shelomi.

   ^28And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the
   son of Ammihud.

   ^29These are they whom the Lord commanded to divide the inheritance
   unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

    Chapter 35

   And the Lord spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near
   Jericho, saying,

   ^2Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of
   the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall
   give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them.

   ^3And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them
   shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their
   beasts.

   ^4And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites,
   shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits
   round about.

   ^5And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two
   thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the
   west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand
   cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the
   suburbs of the cities.

   ^6And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall
   be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer,
   that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two
   cities.

   ^7So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty
   and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.

   ^8And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the
   children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but
   from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his
   cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he
   inheriteth.

   ^9And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^10Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be
   come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

   ^11Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you;
   that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.

   ^12And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that
   the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in
   judgment.

   ^13And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for
   refuge.

   ^14Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities
   shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.

   ^15These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel,
   and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one
   that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.

   ^16And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he
   is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.

   ^17And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and
   he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.

   ^18Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may
   die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to
   death.

   ^19The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he
   meeteth him, he shall slay him.

   ^20But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait,
   that he die;

   ^21Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him
   shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of
   blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.

   ^22But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him
   any thing without laying of wait,

   ^23Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast
   it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his
   harm:

   ^24Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the
   revenger of blood according to these judgments:

   ^25And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the
   revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city
   of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the
   death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.

   ^26But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the
   city of his refuge, whither he was fled;

   ^27And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city
   of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not
   be guilty of blood:

   ^28Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the
   death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the
   slayer shall return into the land of his possession.

   ^29So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you
   throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

   ^30Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the
   mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any
   person to cause him to die.

   ^31Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer,
   which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.

   ^32And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city
   of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until
   the death of the priest.

   ^33So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it
   defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is
   shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.

   ^34Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I
   dwell: for I the Lord dwell among the children of Israel.

    Chapter 36

   And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the
   son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of
   Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the
   chief fathers of the children of Israel:

   ^2And they said, The Lord commanded my lord to give the land for an
   inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded
   by the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his
   daughters.

   ^3And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the
   children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the
   inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the
   tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of
   our inheritance.

   ^4And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall
   their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto
   they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the
   inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.

   ^5And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of
   the Lord, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.

   ^6This is the thing which the Lord doth command concerning the
   daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think
   best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.

   ^7So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from
   tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep
   himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

   ^8And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of
   the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the
   tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man
   the inheritance of his fathers.

   ^9Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe;
   but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep
   himself to his own inheritance.

   ^10Even as the Lord commanded Moses, so did the daughters of
   Zelophehad:

   ^11For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters
   of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons:

   ^12And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the
   son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the
   family of their father.

   ^13These are the commandments and the judgments, which the Lord
   commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the
   plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

  The Fifth Book of Moses, called

Deuteronomy
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 1

   These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side
   Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea,
   between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.

   ^2(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir
   unto Kadeshbarnea.)

   ^3And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on
   the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of
   Israel, according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment
   unto them;

   ^4After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in
   Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:

   ^5On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this
   law, saying,

   ^6The Lord our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long
   enough in this mount:

   ^7Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites,
   and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and
   in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the
   Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river
   Euphrates.

   ^8Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land
   which the Lord sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to
   give unto them and to their seed after them.

   ^9And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you
   myself alone:

   ^10The Lord your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day
   as the stars of heaven for multitude.

   ^11(The Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more
   as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)

   ^12How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and
   your strife?

   ^13Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes,
   and I will make them rulers over you.

   ^14And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is
   good for us to do.

   ^15So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made
   them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over
   hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and
   officers among your tribes.

   ^16And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes
   between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his
   brother, and the stranger that is with him.

   ^17Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the
   small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man;
   for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you,
   bring it unto me, and I will hear it.

   ^18And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.

   ^19And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and
   terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the
   Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us; and we came to
   Kadeshbarnea.

   ^20And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites,
   which the Lord our God doth give unto us.

   ^21Behold, the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and
   possess it, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear
   not, neither be discouraged.

   ^22And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send
   men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word
   again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.

   ^23And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of
   a tribe:

   ^24And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the
   valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.

   ^25And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought
   it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land
   which the Lord our God doth give us.

   ^26Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the
   commandment of the Lord your God:

   ^27And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the Lord hated us,
   he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into
   the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.

   ^28Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart,
   saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great
   and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the
   Anakims there.

   ^29Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.

   ^30The Lord your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you,
   according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;

   ^31And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the Lord thy
   God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went,
   until ye came into this place.

   ^32Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God,

   ^33Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch
   your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go,
   and in a cloud by day.

   ^34And the Lord heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and
   sware, saying,

   ^35Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see
   that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,

   ^36Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I
   give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because
   he hath wholly followed the Lord.

   ^37Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also
   shalt not go in thither.

   ^38But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go
   in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.

   ^39Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your
   children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil,
   they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall
   possess it.

   ^40But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness
   by the way of the Red sea.

   ^41Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the Lord,
   we will go up and fight, according to all that the Lord our God
   commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war,
   ye were ready to go up into the hill.

   ^42And the Lord said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight;
   for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.

   ^43So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the
   commandment of the Lord, and went presumptuously up into the hill.

   ^44And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against
   you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto
   Hormah.

   ^45And ye returned and wept before the Lord; but the Lord would not
   hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.

   ^46So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye
   abode there.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 2

   Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of
   the Red sea, as the Lord spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir
   many days.

   ^2And the Lord spake unto me, saying,

   ^3Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.

   ^4And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast
   of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they
   shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:

   ^5Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not
   so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau
   for a possession.

   ^6Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall
   also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.

   ^7For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand:
   he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years
   the Lord thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.

   ^8And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which
   dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from
   Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.

   ^9And the Lord said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend
   with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a
   possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a
   possession.

   ^10The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and
   tall, as the Anakims;

   ^11Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites
   call them Emims.

   ^12The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau
   succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and
   dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession,
   which the Lord gave unto them.

   ^13Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went
   over the brook Zered.

   ^14And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come
   over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the
   generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as
   the Lord sware unto them.

   ^15For indeed the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them
   from among the host, until they were consumed.

   ^16So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead
   from among the people,

   ^17That the Lord spake unto me, saying,

   ^18Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:

   ^19And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,
   distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of
   the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given
   it unto the children of Lot for a possession.

   ^20(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in
   old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;

   ^21A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the Lord
   destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their
   stead:

   ^22As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he
   destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and
   dwelt in their stead even unto this day:

   ^23And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the
   Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt
   in their stead.)

   ^24Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon:
   behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of
   Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in
   battle.

   ^25This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee
   upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report
   of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.

   ^26And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon
   king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,

   ^27Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I
   will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.

   ^28Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water
   for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;

   ^29(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which
   dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land
   which the Lord our God giveth us.

   ^30But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the Lord
   thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he
   might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.

   ^31And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and
   his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his
   land.

   ^32Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at
   Jahaz.

   ^33And the Lord our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and
   his sons, and all his people.

   ^34And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the
   men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to
   remain:

   ^35Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of
   the cities which we took.

   ^36From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from
   the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city
   too strong for us: the Lord our God delivered all unto us:

   ^37Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor
   unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the
   mountains, nor unto whatsoever the Lord our God forbad us.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 3

   Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of
   Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.

   ^2And the Lord said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and
   all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him
   as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

   ^3So the Lord our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of
   Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him
   remaining.

   ^4And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which
   we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the
   kingdom of Og in Bashan.

   ^5All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside
   unwalled towns a great many.

   ^6And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon,
   utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.

   ^7But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey
   to ourselves.

   ^8And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the
   Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon
   unto mount Hermon;

   ^9(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it
   Shenir;)

   ^10All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto
   Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

   ^11For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;
   behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of
   the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four
   cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.

   ^12And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is
   by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave
   I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.

   ^13And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og,
   gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with
   all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.

   ^14Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the
   coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name,
   Bashan- Havothjair, unto this day.

   ^15And I gave Gilead unto Machir.

   ^16And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even
   unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the
   river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;

   ^17The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth
   even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah
   eastward.

   ^18And I commanded you at that time, saying, The Lord your God hath
   given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your
   brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.

   ^19But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know
   that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have
   given you;

   ^20Until the Lord have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto
   you, and until they also possess the land which the Lord your God hath
   given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his
   possession, which I have given you.

   ^21And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen
   all that the Lord your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the
   Lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.

   ^22Ye shall not fear them: for the Lord your God he shall fight for
   you.

   ^23And I besought the Lord at that time, saying,

   ^24O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and
   thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can
   do according to thy works, and according to thy might?

   ^25I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond
   Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.

   ^26But the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear
   me: and the Lord said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto
   me of this matter.

   ^27Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward,
   and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine
   eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

   ^28But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he
   shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit
   the land which thou shalt see.

   ^29So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.

    Chapter 4

   Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the
   judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go
   in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you.

   ^2Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye
   diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord
   your God which I command you.

   ^3Your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baalpeor: for all
   the men that followed Baalpeor, the Lord thy God hath destroyed them
   from among you.

   ^4But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of
   you this day.

   ^5Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord my
   God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to
   possess it.

   ^6Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your
   understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these
   statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding
   people.

   ^7For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as
   the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for?

   ^8And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments
   so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?

   ^9Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou
   forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from
   thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy
   sons' sons;

   ^10Specially the day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in
   Horeb, when the Lord said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I
   will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the
   days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their
   children.

   ^11And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain
   burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and
   thick darkness.

   ^12And the Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard
   the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice.

   ^13And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to
   perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of
   stone.

   ^14And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and
   judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to
   possess it.

   ^15Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of
   similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the
   midst of the fire:

   ^16Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the
   similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,

   ^17The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any
   winged fowl that flieth in the air,

   ^18The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness
   of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:

   ^19And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest
   the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven,
   shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy
   God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.

   ^20But the Lord hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron
   furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as
   ye are this day.

   ^21Furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, and sware
   that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that
   good land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:

   ^22But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall
   go over, and possess that good land.

   ^23Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord
   your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the
   likeness of any thing, which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee.

   ^24For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.

   ^25When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye
   shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and
   make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in
   the sight of the Lord thy God, to provoke him to anger:

   ^26I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye
   shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan
   to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall
   utterly be destroyed.

   ^27And the Lord shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be
   left few in number among the heathen, whither the Lord shall lead you.

   ^28And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and
   stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.

   ^29But if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find
   him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.

   ^30When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon
   thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the Lord thy God, and
   shalt be obedient unto his voice;

   ^31(For the Lord thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee,
   neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he
   sware unto them.

   ^32For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since
   the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side
   of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as
   this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?

   ^33Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of
   the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?

   ^34Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of
   another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war,
   and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors,
   according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before
   your eyes?

   ^35Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the Lord he is
   God; there is none else beside him.

   ^36Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct
   thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest
   his words out of the midst of the fire.

   ^37And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed
   after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out
   of Egypt;

   ^38To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou
   art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as
   it is this day.

   ^39Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the
   Lord he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is
   none else.

   ^40Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which
   I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy
   children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the
   earth, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, for ever.

   ^41Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the
   sunrising;

   ^42That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour
   unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of
   these cities he might live:

   ^43Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the
   Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan,
   of the Manassites.

   ^44And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:

   ^45These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments,
   which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth
   out of Egypt,

   ^46On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the
   land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses
   and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of
   Egypt:

   ^47And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two
   kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the
   sunrising;

   ^48From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount
   Sion, which is Hermon,

   ^49And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of
   the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 5

   And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the
   statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may
   learn them, and keep, and do them.

   ^2The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

   ^3The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even
   us, who are all of us here alive this day.

   ^4The Lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst
   of the fire,

   ^5(I stood between the Lord and you at that time, to shew you the word
   of the Lord: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up
   into the mount;) saying,

   ^6I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt,
   from the house of bondage.

   ^7Thou shalt have none other gods before me.

   ^8Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any
   thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that
   is in the waters beneath the earth:

   ^9Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the
   Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
   upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that
   hate me,

   ^10And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my
   commandments.

   ^11Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the
   Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

   ^12Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God hath
   commanded thee.

   ^13Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:

   ^14But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou
   shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy
   manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any
   of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy
   manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.

   ^15And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that
   the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a
   stretched out arm: therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep
   the sabbath day.

   ^16Honour thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God hath commanded
   thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with
   thee, in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

   ^17Thou shalt not kill.

   ^18Neither shalt thou commit adultery.

   ^19Neither shalt thou steal.

   ^20Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.

   ^21Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou
   covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his
   maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's.

   ^22These words the Lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out
   of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with
   a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of
   stone, and delivered them unto me.

   ^23And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the
   darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto
   me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;

   ^24And ye said, Behold, the Lord our God hath shewed us his glory and
   his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the
   fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.

   ^25Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume
   us: if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, then we shall
   die.

   ^26For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the
   living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and
   lived?

   ^27Go thou near, and hear all that the Lord our God shall say: and
   speak thou unto us all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee; and
   we will hear it, and do it.

   ^28And the Lord heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me;
   and the Lord said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this
   people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that
   they have spoken.

   ^29O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me,
   and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them,
   and with their children for ever!

   ^30Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.

   ^31But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee
   all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou
   shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them
   to possess it.

   ^32Ye shall observe to do therefore as the Lord your God hath commanded
   you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.

   ^33Ye shall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God hath commanded
   you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye
   may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 6

   Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which
   the Lord your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the
   land whither ye go to possess it:

   ^2That thou mightest fear the Lord thy God, to keep all his statutes
   and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy
   son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be
   prolonged.

   ^3Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well
   with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the Lord God of thy
   fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and
   honey.

   ^4Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord:

   ^5And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with
   all thy soul, and with all thy might.

   ^6And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine
   heart:

   ^7And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt
   talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by
   the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

   ^8And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall
   be as frontlets between thine eyes.

   ^9And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy
   gates.

   ^10And it shall be, when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into
   the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to
   Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not,

   ^11And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and
   wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which
   thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full;

   ^12Then beware lest thou forget the Lord, which brought thee forth out
   of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

   ^13Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by
   his name.

   ^14Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which
   are round about you;

   ^15(For the Lord thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of
   the Lord thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the
   face of the earth.

   ^16Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God, as ye tempted him in Massah.

   ^17Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the Lord your God, and
   his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.

   ^18And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the
   Lord: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and
   possess the good land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers,

   ^19To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the Lord hath
   spoken.

   ^20And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the
   testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the Lord our
   God hath commanded you?

   ^21Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in
   Egypt; and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:

   ^22And the Lord shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt,
   upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:

   ^23And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to
   give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.

   ^24And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the Lord
   our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is
   at this day.

   ^25And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these
   commandments before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 7

   When the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest
   to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the
   Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites,
   and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations
   greater and mightier than thou;

   ^2And when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt
   smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with
   them, nor shew mercy unto them:

   ^3Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt
   not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.

   ^4For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may
   serve other gods: so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you,
   and destroy thee suddenly.

   ^5But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and
   break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their
   graven images with fire.

   ^6For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God
   hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people
   that are upon the face of the earth.

   ^7The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye
   were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all
   people:

   ^8But because the Lord loved you, and because he would keep the oath
   which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the Lord brought you out
   with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from
   the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

   ^9Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God,
   which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his
   commandments to a thousand generations;

   ^10And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he
   will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his
   face.

   ^11Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and
   the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.

   ^12Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments,
   and keep, and do them, that the Lord thy God shall keep unto thee the
   covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:

   ^13And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will
   also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn,
   and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks
   of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee.

   ^14Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or
   female barren among you, or among your cattle.

   ^15And the Lord will take away from thee all sickness, and will put
   none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but
   will lay them upon all them that hate thee.

   ^16And thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall
   deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt
   thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.

   ^17If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how
   can I dispossess them?

   ^18Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the
   Lord thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;

   ^19The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the
   wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the
   Lord thy God brought thee out: so shall the Lord thy God do unto all
   the people of whom thou art afraid.

   ^20Moreover the Lord thy God will send the hornet among them, until
   they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.

   ^21Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the Lord thy God is among
   you, a mighty God and terrible.

   ^22And the Lord thy God will put out those nations before thee by
   little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the
   beasts of the field increase upon thee.

   ^23But the Lord thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy
   them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.

   ^24And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt
   destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to
   stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.

   ^25The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt
   not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee,
   lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the Lord thy
   God.

   ^26Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou
   be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou
   shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.

    Chapter 8

   All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to
   do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land
   which the Lord sware unto your fathers.

   ^2And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee
   these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee,
   to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his
   commandments, or no.

   ^3And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with
   manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he
   might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every
   word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live.

   ^4Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell,
   these forty years.

   ^5Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth
   his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee.

   ^6Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, to
   walk in his ways, and to fear him.

   ^7For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks
   of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;

   ^8A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and
   pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;

   ^9A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt
   not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of
   whose hills thou mayest dig brass.

   ^10When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the Lord
   thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.

   ^11Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, in not keeping his
   commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee
   this day:

   ^12Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly
   houses, and dwelt therein;

   ^13And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy
   gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;

   ^14Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God,
   which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of
   bondage;

   ^15Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein
   were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no
   water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint;

   ^16Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew
   not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do
   thee good at thy latter end;

   ^17And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand
   hath gotten me this wealth.

   ^18But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God: for it is he that giveth
   thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he
   sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.

   ^19And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the Lord thy God, and walk
   after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against
   you this day that ye shall surely perish.

   ^20As the nations which the Lord destroyeth before your face, so shall
   ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the Lord
   your God.

    Chapter 9

   Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to
   possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and
   fenced up to heaven,

   ^2A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou
   knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the
   children of Anak!

   ^3Understand therefore this day, that the Lord thy God is he which
   goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and
   he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out,
   and destroy them quickly, as the Lord hath said unto thee.

   ^4Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the Lord thy God hath cast
   them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the Lord hath
   brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these
   nations the Lord doth drive them out from before thee.

   ^5Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart,
   dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these
   nations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that
   he may perform the word which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, Abraham,
   Isaac, and Jacob.

   ^6Understand therefore, that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this good
   land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked
   people.

   ^7Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the Lord thy God to
   wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the
   land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious
   against the Lord.

   ^8Also in Horeb ye provoked the Lord to wrath, so that the Lord was
   angry with you to have destroyed you.

   ^9When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone,
   even the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with you, then I
   abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread
   nor drink water:

   ^10And the Lord delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the
   finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words,
   which the Lord spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire
   in the day of the assembly.

   ^11And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that
   the Lord gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the
   covenant.

   ^12And the Lord said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence;
   for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have
   corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way
   which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.

   ^13Furthermore the Lord spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people,
   and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:

   ^14Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from
   under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater
   than they.

   ^15So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with
   fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.

   ^16And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the Lord your God,
   and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the
   way which the Lord had commanded you.

   ^17And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and
   brake them before your eyes.

   ^18And I fell down before the Lord, as at the first, forty days and
   forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all
   your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord,
   to provoke him to anger.

   ^19For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the
   Lord was wroth against you to destroy you. But the Lord hearkened unto
   me at that time also.

   ^20And the Lord was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I
   prayed for Aaron also the same time.

   ^21And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with
   fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as
   small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that
   descended out of the mount.

   ^22And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked
   the Lord to wrath.

   ^23Likewise when the Lord sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and
   possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the
   commandment of the Lord your God, and ye believed him not, nor
   hearkened to his voice.

   ^24Ye have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew
   you.

   ^25Thus I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights, as I
   fell down at the first; because the Lord had said he would destroy you.

   ^26I prayed therefore unto the Lord, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not
   thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy
   greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty
   hand.

   ^27Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the
   stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:

   ^28Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the Lord
   was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and
   because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the
   wilderness.

   ^29Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest
   out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 10

   At that time the Lord said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like
   unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an
   ark of wood.

   ^2And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first
   tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.

   ^3And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like
   unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in
   mine hand.

   ^4And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten
   commandments, which the Lord spake unto you in the mount out of the
   midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the Lord gave them
   unto me.

   ^5And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables
   in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the Lord commanded
   me.

   ^6And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the
   children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was
   buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his
   stead.

   ^7From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to
   Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.

   ^8At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of
   the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister unto
   him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.

   ^9Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the
   Lord is his inheritance, according as the Lord thy God promised him.

   ^10And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days
   and forty nights; and the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also, and
   the Lord would not destroy thee.

   ^11And the Lord said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the
   people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto
   their fathers to give unto them.

   ^12And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to
   fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to
   serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,

   ^13To keep the commandments of the Lord, and his statutes, which I
   command thee this day for thy good?

   ^14Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the Lord'S thy God,
   the earth also, with all that therein is.

   ^15Only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he
   chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this
   day.

   ^16Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more
   stiffnecked.

   ^17For the Lord your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great
   God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh
   reward:

   ^18He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth
   the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.

   ^19Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of
   Egypt.

   ^20Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him
   shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.

   ^21He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these
   great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.

   ^22Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons;
   and now the Lord thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for
   multitude.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 11

   Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and keep his charge, and
   his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.

   ^2And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which have
   not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the Lord your
   God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,

   ^3And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt
   unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;

   ^4And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to
   their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them
   as they pursued after you, and how the Lord hath destroyed them unto
   this day;

   ^5And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this
   place;

   ^6And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of
   Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and
   their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in
   their possession, in the midst of all Israel:

   ^7But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which he did.

   ^8Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this
   day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye
   go to possess it;

   ^9And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the Lord sware
   unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that
   floweth with milk and honey.

   ^10For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the
   land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed,
   and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:

   ^11But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and
   valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:

   ^12A land which the Lord thy God careth for: the eyes of the Lord thy
   God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the
   end of the year.

   ^13And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my
   commandments which I command you this day, to love the Lord your God,
   and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,

   ^14That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the
   first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn,
   and thy wine, and thine oil.

   ^15And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest
   eat and be full.

   ^16Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye
   turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;

   ^17And then the Lord'S wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the
   heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit;
   and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth
   you.

   ^18Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your
   soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as
   frontlets between your eyes.

   ^19And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou
   sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou
   liest down, and when thou risest up.

   ^20And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and
   upon thy gates:

   ^21That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in
   the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give them, as the
   days of heaven upon the earth.

   ^22For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I
   command you, to do them, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all his
   ways, and to cleave unto him;

   ^23Then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you, and
   ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.

   ^24Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be
   yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river
   Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.

   ^25There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the Lord your
   God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land
   that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.

   ^26Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;

   ^27A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which
   I command you this day:

   ^28And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your
   God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go
   after other gods, which ye have not known.

   ^29And it shall come to pass, when the Lord thy God hath brought thee
   in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put
   the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.

   ^30Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun
   goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign
   over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?

   ^31For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the
   Lord your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.

   ^32And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I
   set before you this day.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 12

   These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in
   the land, which the Lord God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it,
   all the days that ye live upon the earth.

   ^2Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye
   shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the
   hills, and under every green tree:

   ^3And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and
   burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of
   their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.

   ^4Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God.

   ^5But unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all
   your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye
   seek, and thither thou shalt come:

   ^6And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices,
   and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and
   your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your
   flocks:

   ^7And there ye shall eat before the Lord your God, and ye shall rejoice
   in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the
   Lord thy God hath blessed thee.

   ^8Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every
   man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.

   ^9For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which
   the Lord your God giveth you.

   ^10But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the Lord
   your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all
   your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;

   ^11Then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to
   cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I
   command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes,
   and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye
   vow unto the Lord:

   ^12And ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God, ye, and your sons,
   and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and
   the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor
   inheritance with you.

   ^13Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in
   every place that thou seest:

   ^14But in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of thy tribes,
   there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all
   that I command thee.

   ^15Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates,
   whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the
   Lord thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may
   eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.

   ^16Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as
   water.

   ^17Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of
   thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy
   flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill
   offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:

   ^18But thou must eat them before the Lord thy God in the place which
   the Lord thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and
   thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy
   gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God in all that thou
   puttest thine hands unto.

   ^19Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as
   thou livest upon the earth.

   ^20When the Lord thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised
   thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to
   eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

   ^21If the place which the Lord thy God hath chosen to put his name
   there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy
   flock, which the Lord hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and
   thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

   ^22Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them:
   the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.

   ^23Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life;
   and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.

   ^24Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.

   ^25Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy
   children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the
   sight of the Lord.

   ^26Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take,
   and go unto the place which the Lord shall choose:

   ^27And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood,
   upon the altar of the Lord thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices
   shall be poured out upon the altar of the Lord thy God, and thou shalt
   eat the flesh.

   ^28Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may
   go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou
   doest that which is good and right in the sight of the Lord thy God.

   ^29When the Lord thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee,
   whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and
   dwellest in their land;

   ^30Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them,
   after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire
   not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods?
   even so will I do likewise.

   ^31Thou shalt not do so unto the Lord thy God: for every abomination to
   the Lord, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even
   their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their
   gods.

   ^32What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not
   add thereto, nor diminish from it.

    Chapter 13

   If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth
   thee a sign or a wonder,

   ^2And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee,
   saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let
   us serve them;

   ^3Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that
   dreamer of dreams: for the Lord your God proveth you, to know whether
   ye love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul.

   ^4Ye shall walk after the Lord your God, and fear him, and keep his
   commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave
   unto him.

   ^5And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death;
   because he hath spoken to turn you away from the Lord your God, which
   brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house
   of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the Lord thy God
   commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the
   midst of thee.

   ^6If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter,
   or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul,
   entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which
   thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;

   ^7Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh
   unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even
   unto the other end of the earth;

   ^8Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall
   thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou
   conceal him:

   ^9But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to
   put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.

   ^10And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath
   sought to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God, which brought thee
   out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

   ^11And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such
   wickedness as this is among you.

   ^12If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the Lord thy God
   hath given thee to dwell there, saying,

   ^13Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you,
   and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and
   serve other gods, which ye have not known;

   ^14Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and,
   behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is
   wrought among you;

   ^15Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge
   of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the
   cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.

   ^16And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the
   street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil
   thereof every whit, for the Lord thy God: and it shall be an heap for
   ever; it shall not be built again.

   ^17And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand:
   that the Lord may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee
   mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath
   sworn unto thy fathers;

   ^18When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep
   all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is
   right in the eyes of the Lord thy God.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 14

   Ye are the children of the Lord your God: ye shall not cut yourselves,
   nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.

   ^2For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God, and the Lord hath
   chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations
   that are upon the earth.

   ^3Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.

   ^4These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the
   goat,

   ^5The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat,
   and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.

   ^6And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into
   two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat.

   ^7Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of
   them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and the
   coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they
   are unclean unto you.

   ^8And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud,
   it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch
   their dead carcase.

   ^9These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins
   and scales shall ye eat:

   ^10And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is
   unclean unto you.

   ^11Of all clean birds ye shall eat.

   ^12But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the
   ossifrage, and the ospray,

   ^13And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,

   ^14And every raven after his kind,

   ^15And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after
   his kind,

   ^16The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,

   ^17And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,

   ^18And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and
   the bat.

   ^19And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they shall
   not be eaten.

   ^20But of all clean fowls ye may eat.

   ^21Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself: thou shalt give
   it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou
   mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto the Lord
   thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.

   ^22Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field
   bringeth forth year by year.

   ^23And thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God, in the place which he
   shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy
   wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy
   flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always.

   ^24And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to
   carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the Lord thy God
   shall choose to set his name there, when the Lord thy God hath blessed
   thee:

   ^25Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine
   hand, and shalt go unto the place which the Lord thy God shall choose:

   ^26And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth
   after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for
   whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the Lord
   thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household,

   ^27And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him;
   for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.

   ^28At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of
   thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:

   ^29And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,)
   and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within
   thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the Lord
   thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest.

    Chapter 15

   At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.

   ^2And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth
   ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his
   neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the Lord'S release.

   ^3Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine
   with thy brother thine hand shall release;

   ^4Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the Lord shall
   greatly bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for
   an inheritance to possess it:

   ^5Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to
   observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day.

   ^6For the Lord thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou
   shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt
   reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.

   ^7If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of
   thy gates in thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, thou shalt
   not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother:

   ^8But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend
   him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.

   ^9Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The
   seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil
   against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto
   the Lord against thee, and it be sin unto thee.

   ^10Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved
   when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the Lord thy God
   shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine
   hand unto.

   ^11For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command
   thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy
   poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.

   ^12And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto
   thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let
   him go free from thee.

   ^13And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him
   go away empty:

   ^14Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy
   floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the Lord thy God
   hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.

   ^15And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of
   Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee
   this thing to day.

   ^16And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee;
   because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee;

   ^17Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear unto the
   door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy
   maidservant thou shalt do likewise.

   ^18It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free
   from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee, in
   serving thee six years: and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all
   that thou doest.

   ^19All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou
   shalt sanctify unto the Lord thy God: thou shalt do no work with the
   firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.

   ^20Thou shalt eat it before the Lord thy God year by year in the place
   which the Lord shall choose, thou and thy household.

   ^21And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or
   have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the Lord thy
   God.

   ^22Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean person
   shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.

   ^23Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon
   the ground as water.

    Chapter 16

   Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the Lord thy God:
   for in the month of Abib the Lord thy God brought thee forth out of
   Egypt by night.

   ^2Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the Lord thy God, of
   the flock and the herd, in the place which the Lord shall choose to
   place his name there.

   ^3Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat
   unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou
   camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest
   remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all
   the days of thy life.

   ^4And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast
   seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which thou
   sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.

   ^5Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which
   the Lord thy God giveth thee:

   ^6But at the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place his
   name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going
   down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.

   ^7And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the Lord thy God
   shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy
   tents.

   ^8Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day
   shall be a solemn assembly to the Lord thy God: thou shalt do no work
   therein.

   ^9Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven
   weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn.

   ^10And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the Lord thy God with a
   tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give
   unto the Lord thy God, according as the Lord thy God hath blessed thee:

   ^11And thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God, thou, and thy son,
   and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the
   Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless,
   and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the Lord thy God
   hath chosen to place his name there.

   ^12And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou
   shalt observe and do these statutes.

   ^13Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that
   thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:

   ^14And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy
   daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the
   stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.

   ^15Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the Lord thy God in
   the place which the Lord shall choose: because the Lord thy God shall
   bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands,
   therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.

   ^16Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the Lord thy
   God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened
   bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and
   they shall not appear before the Lord empty:

   ^17Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the
   Lord thy God which he hath given thee.

   ^18Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the
   Lord thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge
   the people with just judgment.

   ^19Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons,
   neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and
   pervert the words of the righteous.

   ^20That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest
   live, and inherit the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

   ^21Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar
   of the Lord thy God, which thou shalt make thee.

   ^22Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the Lord thy God
   hateth.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 17

   Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the Lord thy God any bullock, or sheep,
   wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that is an abomination
   unto the Lord thy God.

   ^2If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the Lord
   thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the
   sight of the Lord thy God, in transgressing his covenant,

   ^3And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the
   sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;

   ^4And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and enquired
   diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such
   abomination is wrought in Israel:

   ^5Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have
   committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that
   woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.

   ^6At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is
   worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he
   shall not be put to death.

   ^7The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to
   death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put the
   evil away from among you.

   ^8If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood
   and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being
   matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get
   thee up into the place which the Lord thy God shall choose;

   ^9And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge
   that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew thee the
   sentence of judgment:

   ^10And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that
   place which the Lord shall choose shall shew thee; and thou shalt
   observe to do according to all that they inform thee:

   ^11According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee,
   and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt
   do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew
   thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.

   ^12And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto
   the priest that standeth to minister there before the Lord thy God, or
   unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the
   evil from Israel.

   ^13And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more
   presumptuously.

   ^14When thou art come unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee,
   and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will
   set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;

   ^15Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the Lord thy God
   shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over
   thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy
   brother.

   ^16But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to
   return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch
   as the Lord hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that
   way.

   ^17Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not
   away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.

   ^18And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom,
   that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which
   is before the priests the Levites:

   ^19And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of
   his life: that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the
   words of this law and these statutes, to do them:

   ^20That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn
   not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to
   the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his
   children, in the midst of Israel.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 18

   The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part
   nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the Lord
   made by fire, and his inheritance.

   ^2Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the
   Lord is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.

   ^3And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them that
   offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall give unto
   the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.

   ^4The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and
   the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.

   ^5For the Lord thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand
   to minister in the name of the Lord, him and his sons for ever.

   ^6And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where
   he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place
   which the Lord shall choose;

   ^7Then he shall minister in the name of the Lord his God, as all his
   brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the Lord.

   ^8They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the
   sale of his patrimony.

   ^9When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee,
   thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.

   ^10There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or
   his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an
   observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,

   ^11Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or
   a necromancer.

   ^12For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord: and
   because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from
   before thee.

   ^13Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God.

   ^14For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto
   observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the Lord thy
   God hath not suffered thee so to do.

   ^15The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of
   thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;

   ^16According to all that thou desiredst of the Lord thy God in Horeb in
   the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the
   Lord my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die
   not.

   ^17And the Lord said unto me, They have well spoken that which they
   have spoken.

   ^18I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto
   thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them
   all that I shall command him.

   ^19And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my
   words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.

   ^20But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name,
   which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the
   name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.

   ^21And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the
   Lord hath not spoken?

   ^22When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow
   not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not
   spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not
   be afraid of him.

    Chapter 19

   When the Lord thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the Lord thy
   God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their
   cities, and in their houses;

   ^2Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land,
   which the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it.

   ^3Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land,
   which the Lord thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that
   every slayer may flee thither.

   ^4And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he
   may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in
   time past;

   ^5As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and
   his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the
   head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he
   die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live:

   ^6Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is
   hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas
   he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.

   ^7Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities
   for thee.

   ^8And if the Lord thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy
   fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy
   fathers;

   ^9If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command
   thee this day, to love the Lord thy God, and to walk ever in his ways;
   then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three:

   ^10That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the Lord thy God
   giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon thee.

   ^11But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise
   up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one
   of these cities:

   ^12Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and
   deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die.

   ^13Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guilt of
   innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.

   ^14Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of old
   time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the
   land that the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it.

   ^15One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for
   any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or
   at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.

   ^16If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him
   that which is wrong;

   ^17Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand
   before the Lord, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in
   those days;

   ^18And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the
   witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely against his
   brother;

   ^19Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his
   brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.

   ^20And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth
   commit no more any such evil among you.

   ^21And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye for
   eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 20

   When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses,
   and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for
   the Lord thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of
   Egypt.

   ^2And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the
   priest shall approach and speak unto the people,

   ^3And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto
   battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and
   do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them;

   ^4For the Lord your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you
   against your enemies, to save you.

   ^5And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is
   there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him
   go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man
   dedicate it.

   ^6And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet
   eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in
   the battle, and another man eat of it.

   ^7And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken
   her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle,
   and another man take her.

   ^8And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall
   say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and
   return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his
   heart.

   ^9And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto
   the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the
   people.

   ^10When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim
   peace unto it.

   ^11And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto
   thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein shall
   be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.

   ^12And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against
   thee, then thou shalt besiege it:

   ^13And when the Lord thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou
   shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:

   ^14But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is
   in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself;
   and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the Lord thy God
   hath given thee.

   ^15Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from
   thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.

   ^16But of the cities of these people, which the Lord thy God doth give
   thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:

   ^17But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and the
   Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the
   Jebusites; as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee:

   ^18That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which
   they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the Lord your
   God.

   ^19When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it
   to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe
   against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them
   down (for the tree of the field is man's life) to employ them in the
   siege:

   ^20Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat,
   thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks
   against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 21

   If one be found slain in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee to
   possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath slain him:

   ^2Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall
   measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:

   ^3And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain man, even
   the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been
   wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;

   ^4And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough
   valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the
   heifer's neck there in the valley:

   ^5And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the Lord
   thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of
   the Lord; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be
   tried:

   ^6And all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain man,
   shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:

   ^7And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood,
   neither have our eyes seen it.

   ^8Be merciful, O Lord, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed,
   and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge. And the
   blood shall be forgiven them.

   ^9So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you,
   when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the Lord.

   ^10When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the Lord thy
   God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them
   captive,

   ^11And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire
   unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;

   ^12Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave
   her head, and pare her nails;

   ^13And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and
   shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a
   full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her
   husband, and she shall be thy wife.

   ^14And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let
   her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money,
   thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.

   ^15If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they
   have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the
   firstborn son be hers that was hated:

   ^16Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he
   hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the
   son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn:

   ^17But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by
   giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he is the
   beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.

   ^18If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the
   voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they
   have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:

   ^19Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him
   out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;

   ^20And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is
   stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton,
   and a drunkard.

   ^21And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he
   die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall
   hear, and fear.

   ^22And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be
   put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:

   ^23His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in
   any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;)
   that thy land be not defiled, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an
   inheritance.

    Chapter 22

   Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide
   thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy
   brother.

   ^2And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not,
   then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be with
   thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him
   again.

   ^3In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with
   his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's, which he hath
   lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide
   thyself.

   ^4Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way,
   and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up
   again.

   ^5The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither
   shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are
   abomination unto the Lord thy God.

   ^6If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or
   on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting
   upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the
   young:

   ^7But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to
   thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy
   days.

   ^8When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for
   thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall
   from thence.

   ^9Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of
   thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be
   defiled.

   ^10Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.

   ^11Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen and
   linen together.

   ^12Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture,
   wherewith thou coverest thyself.

   ^13If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,

   ^14And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name
   upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found
   her not a maid:

   ^15Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring
   forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city
   in the gate:

   ^16And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my
   daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;

   ^17And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her, saying, I
   found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my
   daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders
   of the city.

   ^18And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;

   ^19And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give
   them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil
   name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put
   her away all his days.

   ^20But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found
   for the damsel:

   ^21Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's
   house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she
   die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her
   father's house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.

   ^22If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then
   they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and
   the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.

   ^23If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man
   find her in the city, and lie with her;

   ^24Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye
   shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she
   cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his
   neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you.

   ^25But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force
   her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die:

   ^26But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no
   sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour,
   and slayeth him, even so is this matter:

   ^27For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and
   there was none to save her.

   ^28If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and
   lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;

   ^29Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father
   fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath
   humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.

   ^30A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover his father's
   skirt.

    Chapter 23

   He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off,
   shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord.

   ^2A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord; even to
   his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the
   Lord.

   ^3An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the
   Lord; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the
   congregation of the Lord for ever:

   ^4Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when
   ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam
   the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee.

   ^5Nevertheless the Lord thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the
   Lord thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the
   Lord thy God loved thee.

   ^6Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for
   ever.

   ^7Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou shalt
   not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land.

   ^8The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the
   congregation of the Lord in their third generation.

   ^9When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee from
   every wicked thing.

   ^10If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of
   uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of
   the camp, he shall not come within the camp:

   ^11But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself with
   water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again.

   ^12Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go
   forth abroad:

   ^13And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when
   thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn
   back and cover that which cometh from thee:

   ^14For the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver
   thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy
   camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from
   thee.

   ^15Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped
   from his master unto thee:

   ^16He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which he
   shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt
   not oppress him.

   ^17There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite
   of the sons of Israel.

   ^18Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog,
   into the house of the Lord thy God for any vow: for even both these are
   abomination unto the Lord thy God.

   ^19Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury
   of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:

   ^20Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother
   thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in
   all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to
   possess it.

   ^21When thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not
   slack to pay it: for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee;
   and it would be sin in thee.

   ^22But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.

   ^23That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; even
   a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the Lord thy
   God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.

   ^24When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou mayest eat
   grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in
   thy vessel.

   ^25When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then thou
   mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle
   unto thy neighbour's standing corn.

    Chapter 24

   When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that
   she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness
   in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in
   her hand, and send her out of his house.

   ^2And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another
   man's wife.

   ^3And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of
   divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his
   house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife;

   ^4Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be
   his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the
   Lord: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the Lord thy God
   giveth thee for an inheritance.

   ^5When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither
   shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free at home one
   year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.

   ^6No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he
   taketh a man's life to pledge.

   ^7If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of
   Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief
   shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.

   ^8Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and
   do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I
   commanded them, so ye shall observe to do.

   ^9Remember what the Lord thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that
   ye were come forth out of Egypt.

   ^10When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into
   his house to fetch his pledge.

   ^11Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall
   bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.

   ^12And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:

   ^13In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun
   goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and
   it shall be righteousness unto thee before the Lord thy God.

   ^14Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy,
   whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land
   within thy gates:

   ^15At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go
   down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he
   cry against thee unto the Lord, and it be sin unto thee.

   ^16The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither
   shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be
   put to death for his own sin.

   ^17Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the
   fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:

   ^18But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the
   Lord thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this
   thing.

   ^19When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a
   sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be
   for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the Lord
   thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.

   ^20When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the
   boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for
   the widow.

   ^21When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean
   it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for
   the widow.

   ^22And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of
   Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.

    Chapter 25

   If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment,
   that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous,
   and condemn the wicked.

   ^2And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the
   judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face,
   according to his fault, by a certain number.

   ^3Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should
   exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother
   should seem vile unto thee.

   ^4Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.

   ^5If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child,
   the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her
   husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife,
   and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her.

   ^6And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed
   in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not put out
   of Israel.

   ^7And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his
   brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's
   brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will
   not perform the duty of my husband's brother.

   ^8Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and
   if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;

   ^9Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the
   elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and
   shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not
   build up his brother's house.

   ^10And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath
   his shoe loosed.

   ^11When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one
   draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that
   smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets:

   ^12Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity her.

   ^13Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small.

   ^14Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a
   small.

   ^15But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just
   measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land
   which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

   ^16For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, are an
   abomination unto the Lord thy God.

   ^17Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come
   forth out of Egypt;

   ^18How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, even all
   that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary; and he
   feared not God.

   ^19Therefore it shall be, when the Lord thy God hath given thee rest
   from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the Lord thy God
   giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shalt blot out
   the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it.

    Chapter 26

   And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the Lord thy
   God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest
   therein;

   ^2That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth,
   which thou shalt bring of thy land that the Lord thy God giveth thee,
   and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the
   Lord thy God shall choose to place his name there.

   ^3And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and
   say unto him, I profess this day unto the Lord thy God, that I am come
   unto the country which the Lord sware unto our fathers for to give us.

   ^4And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it
   down before the altar of the Lord thy God.

   ^5And thou shalt speak and say before the Lord thy God, A Syrian ready
   to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned
   there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and
   populous:

   ^6And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon
   us hard bondage:

   ^7And when we cried unto the Lord God of our fathers, the Lord heard
   our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our
   oppression:

   ^8And the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and
   with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs,
   and with wonders:

   ^9And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land,
   even a land that floweth with milk and honey.

   ^10And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which
   thou, O Lord, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the Lord thy
   God, and worship before the Lord thy God:

   ^11And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the Lord thy God
   hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and
   the stranger that is among you.

   ^12When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine
   increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given
   it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that
   they may eat within thy gates, and be filled;

   ^13Then thou shalt say before the Lord thy God, I have brought away the
   hallowed things out of mine house, and also have given them unto the
   Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow,
   according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have
   not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them:

   ^14I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away
   ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the
   dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord my God, and have
   done according to all that thou hast commanded me.

   ^15Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy
   people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest
   unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.

   ^16This day the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes
   and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine
   heart, and with all thy soul.

   ^17Thou hast avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in
   his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his
   judgments, and to hearken unto his voice:

   ^18And the Lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people,
   as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his
   commandments;

   ^19And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in
   praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy
   people unto the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken.

    Chapter 27

   And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep
   all the commandments which I command you this day.

   ^2And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the
   land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up
   great stones, and plaister them with plaister:

   ^3And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou
   art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land which the Lord
   thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the
   Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee.

   ^4Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye shall set
   up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou
   shalt plaister them with plaister.

   ^5And there shalt thou build an altar unto the Lord thy God, an altar
   of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them.

   ^6Thou shalt build the altar of the Lord thy God of whole stones: and
   thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the Lord thy God:

   ^7And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and
   rejoice before the Lord thy God.

   ^8And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very
   plainly.

   ^9And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel, saying,
   Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the people
   of the Lord thy God.

   ^10Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the Lord thy God, and do his
   commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day.

   ^11And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,

   ^12These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye
   are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and
   Joseph, and Benjamin:

   ^13And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and
   Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

   ^14And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel with
   a loud voice,

   ^15Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an
   abomination unto the Lord, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and
   putteth it in a secret place. And all the people shall answer and say,
   Amen.

   ^16Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother. And all
   the people shall say, Amen.

   ^17Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmark. And all the
   people shall say, Amen.

   ^18Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And all
   the people shall say, Amen.

   ^19Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger,
   fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.

   ^20Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; because he
   uncovereth his father's skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen.

   ^21Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the people
   shall say, Amen.

   ^22Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father,
   or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.

   ^23Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law. And all the people
   shall say, Amen.

   ^24Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all the people
   shall say, Amen.

   ^25Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person. And all
   the people shall say, Amen.

   ^26Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do
   them. And all the people shall say, Amen.

    Chapter 28

   And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the
   voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments
   which I command thee this day, that the Lord thy God will set thee on
   high above all nations of the earth:

   ^2And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if
   thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God.

   ^3Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the
   field.

   ^4Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground,
   and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks
   of thy sheep.

   ^5Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.

   ^6Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be
   when thou goest out.

   ^7The Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be
   smitten before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way, and
   flee before thee seven ways.

   ^8The Lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses, and
   in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and he shall bless thee in
   the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

   ^9The Lord shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as he hath
   sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord thy
   God, and walk in his ways.

   ^10And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the
   name of the Lord; and they shall be afraid of thee.

   ^11And the Lord shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy
   body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground,
   in the land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers to give thee.

   ^12The Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to give
   the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of
   thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not
   borrow.

   ^13And the Lord shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou
   shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou
   hearken unto the commandments of the Lord thy God, which I command thee
   this day, to observe and to do them:

   ^14And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command
   thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other
   gods to serve them.

   ^15But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice
   of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his
   statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall
   come upon thee, and overtake thee:

   ^16Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the
   field.

   ^17Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.

   ^18Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land,
   the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.

   ^19Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be
   when thou goest out.

   ^20The Lord shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all
   that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be destroyed,
   and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings,
   whereby thou hast forsaken me.

   ^21The Lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have
   consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess it.

   ^22The Lord shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and
   with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword,
   and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until
   thou perish.

   ^23And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth
   that is under thee shall be iron.

   ^24The Lord shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from
   heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.

   ^25The Lord shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies: thou
   shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and
   shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.

   ^26And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto
   the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.

   ^27The Lord will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the
   emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not
   be healed.

   ^28The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and
   astonishment of heart:

   ^29And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness,
   and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only
   oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save thee.

   ^30Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou
   shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt
   plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof.

   ^31Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat
   thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face,
   and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto thine
   enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them.

   ^32Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and
   thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long:
   and there shall be no might in thine hand.

   ^33The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which
   thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed
   alway:

   ^34So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou
   shalt see.

   ^35The Lord shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore
   botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of
   thy head.

   ^36The Lord shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over
   thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and
   there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.

   ^37And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword,
   among all nations whither the Lord shall lead thee.

   ^38Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather but
   little in; for the locust shall consume it.

   ^39Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither drink
   of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.

   ^40Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou
   shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his
   fruit.

   ^41Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them;
   for they shall go into captivity.

   ^42All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.

   ^43The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high;
   and thou shalt come down very low.

   ^44He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be
   the head, and thou shalt be the tail.

   ^45Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue
   thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou
   hearkenedst not unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his
   commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:

   ^46And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon
   thy seed for ever.

   ^47Because thou servedst not the Lord thy God with joyfulness, and with
   gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;

   ^48Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the Lord shall send
   against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want
   of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he
   have destroyed thee.

   ^49The Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of
   the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou
   shalt not understand;

   ^50A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of
   the old, nor shew favour to the young:

   ^51And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land,
   until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either corn,
   wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep,
   until he have destroyed thee.

   ^52And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and
   fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy
   land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy
   land, which the Lord thy God hath given thee.

   ^53And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy
   sons and of thy daughters, which the Lord thy God hath given thee, in
   the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall
   distress thee:

   ^54So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye
   shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and
   toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:

   ^55So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children
   whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and
   in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all
   thy gates.

   ^56The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure
   to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and
   tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and
   toward her son, and toward her daughter,

   ^57And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and
   toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for
   want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith
   thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.

   ^58If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are
   written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful
   name, THE Lord THY GOD;

   ^59Then the Lord will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of
   thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore
   sicknesses, and of long continuance.

   ^60Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which
   thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.

   ^61Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the
   book of this law, them will the Lord bring upon thee, until thou be
   destroyed.

   ^62And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of
   heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the
   Lord thy God.

   ^63And it shall come to pass, that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do
   you good, and to multiply you; so the Lord will rejoice over you to
   destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from
   off the land whither thou goest to possess it.

   ^64And the Lord shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end
   of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other
   gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and
   stone.

   ^65And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the
   sole of thy foot have rest: but the Lord shall give thee there a
   trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:

   ^66And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear
   day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:

   ^67In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even
   thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart
   wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou
   shalt see.

   ^68And the Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the
   way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and
   there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and
   no man shall buy you.

    Chapter 29

   These are the words of the covenant, which the Lord commanded Moses to
   make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the
   covenant which he made with them in Horeb.

   ^2And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen
   all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto
   Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land;

   ^3The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and
   those great miracles:

   ^4Yet the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to
   see, and ears to hear, unto this day.

   ^5And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are
   not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot.

   ^6Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink:
   that ye might know that I am the Lord your God.

   ^7And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og
   the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them:

   ^8And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the
   Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.

   ^9Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may
   prosper in all that ye do.

   ^10Ye stand this day all of you before the Lord your God; your captains
   of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all the men of
   Israel,

   ^11Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp,
   from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:

   ^12That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the Lord thy God, and
   into his oath, which the Lord thy God maketh with thee this day:

   ^13That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and
   that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he
   hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

   ^14Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;

   ^15But with him that standeth here with us this day before the Lord our
   God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:

   ^16(For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came
   through the nations which ye passed by;

   ^17And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and
   stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)

   ^18Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe,
   whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord our God, to go and
   serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root
   that beareth gall and wormwood;

   ^19And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that
   he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I
   walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:

   ^20The Lord will not spare him, but then the anger of the Lord and his
   jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are
   written in this book shall lie upon him, and the Lord shall blot out
   his name from under heaven.

   ^21And the Lord shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of
   Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in
   this book of the law:

   ^22So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up
   after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say,
   when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the
   Lord hath laid upon it;

   ^23And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning,
   that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like
   the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the Lord
   overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:

   ^24Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto
   this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?

   ^25Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the
   Lord God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them
   forth out of the land of Egypt:

   ^26For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom
   they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:

   ^27And the anger of the Lord was kindled against this land, to bring
   upon it all the curses that are written in this book:

   ^28And the Lord rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath,
   and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is
   this day.

   ^29The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things
   which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we
   may do all the words of this law.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 30

   And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee,
   the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou
   shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the Lord thy God
   hath driven thee,

   ^2And shalt return unto the Lord thy God, and shalt obey his voice
   according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children,
   with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;

   ^3That then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have
   compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the
   nations, whither the Lord thy God hath scattered thee.

   ^4If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from
   thence will the Lord thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch
   thee:

   ^5And the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers
   possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and
   multiply thee above thy fathers.

   ^6And the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of
   thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all
   thy soul, that thou mayest live.

   ^7And the Lord thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies,
   and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.

   ^8And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the Lord, and do all his
   commandments which I command thee this day.

   ^9And the Lord thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine
   hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in
   the fruit of thy land, for good: for the Lord will again rejoice over
   thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers:

   ^10If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep
   his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the
   law, and if thou turn unto the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and
   with all thy soul.

   ^11For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden
   from thee, neither is it far off.

   ^12It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us
   to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?

   ^13Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go
   over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do
   it?

   ^14But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart,
   that thou mayest do it.

   ^15See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and
   evil;

   ^16In that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in
   his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his
   judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the Lord thy God
   shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.

   ^17But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt
   be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;

   ^18I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that
   ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over
   Jordan to go to possess it.

   ^19I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have
   set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose
   life, that both thou and thy seed may live:

   ^20That thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest obey
   his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life,
   and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which
   the Lord sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to
   give them.

    Chapter 31

   And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.

   ^2And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day;
   I can no more go out and come in: also the Lord hath said unto me, Thou
   shalt not go over this Jordan.

   ^3The Lord thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy
   these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and
   Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the Lord hath said.

   ^4And the Lord shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings
   of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.

   ^5And the Lord shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto
   them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you.

   ^6Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for
   the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail
   thee, nor forsake thee.

   ^7And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all
   Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this
   people unto the land which the Lord hath sworn unto their fathers to
   give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.

   ^8And the Lord, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with
   thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be
   dismayed.

   ^9And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons
   of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and unto all
   the elders of Israel.

   ^10And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years,
   in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,

   ^11When all Israel is come to appear before the Lord thy God in the
   place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel
   in their hearing.

   ^12Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy
   stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they
   may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and observe to do all the words
   of this law:

   ^13And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear,
   and learn to fear the Lord your God, as long as ye live in the land
   whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

   ^14And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou
   must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the
   congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went,
   and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^15And the Lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and
   the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.

   ^16And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy
   fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods
   of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and
   will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.

   ^17Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will
   forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be
   devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they
   will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God
   is not among us?

   ^18And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which
   they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.

   ^19Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children
   of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for
   me against the children of Israel.

   ^20For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto
   their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have
   eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto
   other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.

   ^21And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen
   them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it
   shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know
   their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought
   them into the land which I sware.

   ^22Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the
   children of Israel.

   ^23And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and
   of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the
   land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.

   ^24And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words
   of this law in a book, until they were finished,

   ^25That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant
   of the Lord, saying,

   ^26Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the
   covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a witness
   against thee.

   ^27For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet
   alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the Lord; and
   how much more after my death?

   ^28Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers,
   that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth
   to record against them.

   ^29For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves,
   and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will
   befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of
   the Lord, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.

   ^30And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the
   words of this song, until they were ended.

    Chapter 32

   Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words
   of my mouth.

   ^2My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the
   dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon
   the grass:

   ^3Because I will publish the name of the Lord: ascribe ye greatness
   unto our God.

   ^4He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a
   God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.

   ^5They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his
   children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.

   ^6Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? is not he
   thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and
   established thee?

   ^7Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask
   thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.

   ^8When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he
   separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according
   to the number of the children of Israel.

   ^9For the Lord'S portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his
   inheritance.

   ^10He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness;
   he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his
   eye.

   ^11As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
   spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:

   ^12So the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with
   him.

   ^13He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat
   the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the
   rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;

   ^14Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of
   the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and
   thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.

   ^15But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art
   grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which
   made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.

   ^16They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations
   provoked they him to anger.

   ^17They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not,
   to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.

   ^18Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten
   God that formed thee.

   ^19And when the Lord saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking
   of his sons, and of his daughters.

   ^20And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their
   end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom
   is no faith.

   ^21They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have
   provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to
   jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to
   anger with a foolish nation.

   ^22For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest
   hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire
   the foundations of the mountains.

   ^23I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.

   ^24They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and
   with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon
   them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.

   ^25The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young
   man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.

   ^26I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the
   remembrance of them to cease from among men:

   ^27Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their
   adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should
   say, Our hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this.

   ^28For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any
   understanding in them.

   ^29O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would
   consider their latter end!

   ^30How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight,
   except their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up?

   ^31For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being
   judges.

   ^32For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
   Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:

   ^33Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.

   ^34Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my
   treasures?

   ^35To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in
   due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that
   shall come upon them make haste.

   ^36For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his
   servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none
   shut up, or left.

   ^37And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they
   trusted,

   ^38Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of
   their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your
   protection.

   ^39See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill,
   and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can
   deliver out of my hand.

   ^40For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.

   ^41If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment;
   I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate
   me.

   ^42I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour
   flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from
   the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.

   ^43Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood
   of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will
   be merciful unto his land, and to his people.

   ^44And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of
   the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.

   ^45And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:

   ^46And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I
   testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to
   observe to do, all the words of this law.

   ^47For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and
   through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye
   go over Jordan to possess it.

   ^48And the Lord spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,

   ^49Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in
   the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of
   Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:

   ^50And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy
   people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto
   his people:

   ^51Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the
   waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye
   sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.

   ^52Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go
   thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 33

   And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the
   children of Israel before his death.

   ^2And he said, The Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto
   them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands
   of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.

   ^3Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they
   sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.

   ^4Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of
   Jacob.

   ^5And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the
   tribes of Israel were gathered together.

   ^6Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.

   ^7And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, Lord, the voice
   of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient
   for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.

   ^8And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy
   one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive
   at the waters of Meribah;

   ^9Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him;
   neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for
   they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.

   ^10They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall
   put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.

   ^11Bless, Lord, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite
   through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate
   him, that they rise not again.

   ^12And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in
   safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he
   shall dwell between his shoulders.

   ^13And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the Lord be his land, for the
   precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth
   beneath,

   ^14And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the
   precious things put forth by the moon,

   ^15And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the
   precious things of the lasting hills,

   ^16And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and
   for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the blessing come
   upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was
   separated from his brethren.

   ^17His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are
   like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together
   to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim,
   and they are the thousands of Manasseh.

   ^18And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and,
   Issachar, in thy tents.

   ^19They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer
   sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of
   the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.

   ^20And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as
   a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.

   ^21And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a
   portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of
   the people, he executed the justice of the Lord, and his judgments with
   Israel.

   ^22And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from
   Bashan.

   ^23And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full
   with the blessing of the Lord: possess thou the west and the south.

   ^24And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be
   acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.

   ^25Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy
   strength be.

   ^26There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the
   heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.

   ^27The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting
   arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall
   say, Destroy them.

   ^28Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall
   be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.

   ^29Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by
   the Lord, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy
   excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou
   shalt tread upon their high places.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 34

   And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to
   the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the Lord shewed
   him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,

   ^2And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the
   land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,

   ^3And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of
   palm trees, unto Zoar.

   ^4And the Lord said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto
   Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy
   seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not
   go over thither.

   ^5So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab,
   according to the word of the Lord.

   ^6And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against
   Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.

   ^7And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye
   was not dim, nor his natural force abated.

   ^8And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab
   thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.

   ^9And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses
   had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto
   him, and did as the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^10And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom
   the Lord knew face to face,

   ^11In all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in
   the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his
   land,

   ^12And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses
   shewed in the sight of all Israel.

Joshua
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 1

   Now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass,
   that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister,
   saying,

   ^2Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan,
   thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even
   to the children of Israel.

   ^3Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I
   given unto you, as I said unto Moses.

   ^4From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the
   river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea
   toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.

   ^5There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of
   thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail
   thee, nor forsake thee.

   ^6Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou
   divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to
   give them.

   ^7Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to
   do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee:
   turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest
   prosper whithersoever thou goest.

   ^8This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou
   shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do
   according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy
   way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.

   ^9Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not
   afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee
   whithersoever thou goest.

   ^10Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,

   ^11Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you
   victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go
   in to possess the land, which the Lord your God giveth you to possess
   it.

   ^12And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of
   Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,

   ^13Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you,
   saying, The Lord your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this
   land.

   ^14Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the
   land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before
   your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;

   ^15Until the Lord have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you,
   and they also have possessed the land which the Lord your God giveth
   them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy
   it, which Moses the Lord'S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward
   the sunrising.

   ^16And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we
   will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.

   ^17According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we
   hearken unto thee: only the Lord thy God be with thee, as he was with
   Moses.

   ^18Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will
   not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be
   put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 2

   And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly,
   saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an
   harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.

   ^2And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men
   in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.

   ^3And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men
   that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be
   come to search out all the country.

   ^4And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There
   came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:

   ^5And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it
   was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue
   after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.

   ^6But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them
   with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.

   ^7And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and
   as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the
   gate.

   ^8And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;

   ^9And she said unto the men, I know that the Lord hath given you the
   land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the
   inhabitants of the land faint because of you.

   ^10For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red sea for
   you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of
   the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye
   utterly destroyed.

   ^11And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,
   neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you:
   for the Lord your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.

   ^12Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the Lord, since I have
   shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's
   house, and give me a true token:

   ^13And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my
   brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives
   from death.

   ^14And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this
   our business. And it shall be, when the Lord hath given us the land,
   that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.

   ^15Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house
   was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.

   ^16And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers
   meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be
   returned: and afterward may ye go your way.

   ^17And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath
   which thou hast made us swear.

   ^18Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of
   scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou
   shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy
   father's household, home unto thee.

   ^19And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy
   house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be
   guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood
   shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.

   ^20And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine
   oath which thou hast made us to swear.

   ^21And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them
   away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.

   ^22And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three
   days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them
   throughout all the way, but found them not.

   ^23So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed
   over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that
   befell them:

   ^24And they said unto Joshua, Truly the Lord hath delivered into our
   hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do
   faint because of us.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 3

   And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim,
   and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there
   before they passed over.

   ^2And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through
   the host;

   ^3And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the
   covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it,
   then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.

   ^4Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand
   cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by
   which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.

   ^5And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow
   the Lord will do wonders among you.

   ^6And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the
   covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of
   the covenant, and went before the people.

   ^7And the Lord said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee
   in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with
   Moses, so I will be with thee.

   ^8And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant,
   saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall
   stand still in Jordan.

   ^9And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear
   the words of the Lord your God.

   ^10And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among
   you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the
   Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and
   the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.

   ^11Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth
   over before you into Jordan.

   ^12Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out
   of every tribe a man.

   ^13And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the
   priests that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall
   rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut
   off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand
   upon an heap.

   ^14And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to
   pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant
   before the people;

   ^15And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of
   the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water,
   (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)

   ^16That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an
   heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those
   that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed,
   and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.

   ^17And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood
   firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites
   passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over
   Jordan.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 4

   And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan,
   that the Lord spake unto Joshua, saying,

   ^2Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,

   ^3And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of
   Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve
   stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the
   lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.

   ^4Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the
   children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:

   ^5And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the Lord your
   God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone
   upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the
   children of Israel:

   ^6That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their
   fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?

   ^7Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off
   before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; when it passed over Jordan,
   the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a
   memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.

   ^8And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up
   twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the Lord spake unto
   Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of
   Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they
   lodged, and laid them down there.

   ^9And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place
   where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood:
   and they are there unto this day.

   ^10For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan,
   until every thing was finished that the Lord commanded Joshua to speak
   unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the
   people hasted and passed over.

   ^11And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over,
   that the ark of the Lord passed over, and the priests, in the presence
   of the people.

   ^12And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the
   tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as
   Moses spake unto them:

   ^13About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the Lord
   unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.

   ^14On that day the Lord magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel;
   and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.

   ^15And the Lord spake unto Joshua, saying,

   ^16Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they
   come up out of Jordan.

   ^17Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of
   Jordan.

   ^18And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the
   covenant of the Lord were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the
   soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the
   waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his
   banks, as they did before.

   ^19And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first
   month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.

   ^20And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua
   pitch in Gilgal.

   ^21And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children
   shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these
   stones?

   ^22Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this
   Jordan on dry land.

   ^23For the Lord your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you,
   until ye were passed over, as the Lord your God did to the Red sea,
   which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:

   ^24That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord,
   that it is mighty: that ye might fear the Lord your God for ever.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 5

   And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on
   the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which
   were by the sea, heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of Jordan
   from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that
   their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because
   of the children of Israel.

   ^2At that time the Lord said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and
   circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.

   ^3And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of
   Israel at the hill of the foreskins.

   ^4And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that
   came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in
   the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.

   ^5Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people
   that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of
   Egypt, them they had not circumcised.

   ^6For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till
   all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were
   consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord: unto whom the
   Lord sware that he would not shew them the land, which the Lord sware
   unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk
   and honey.

   ^7And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua
   circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not
   circumcised them by the way.

   ^8And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people,
   that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.

   ^9And the Lord said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the
   reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is
   called Gilgal unto this day.

   ^10And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover
   on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.

   ^11And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the
   passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.

   ^12And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old
   corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more;
   but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.

   ^13And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up
   his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him
   with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said
   unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?

   ^14And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now
   come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and
   said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?

   ^15And the captain of the Lord'S host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe
   from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And
   Joshua did so.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 6

   Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel:
   none went out, and none came in.

   ^2And the Lord said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand
   Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.

   ^3And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about
   the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.

   ^4And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams'
   horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and
   the priests shall blow with the trumpets.

   ^5And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the
   ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people
   shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall
   down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before
   him.

   ^6And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them,
   Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven
   trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the Lord.

   ^7And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let
   him that is armed pass on before the ark of the Lord.

   ^8And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the
   seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on
   before the Lord, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the
   covenant of the Lord followed them.

   ^9And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the
   trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on,
   and blowing with the trumpets.

   ^10And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor
   make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of
   your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.

   ^11So the ark of the Lord compassed the city, going about it once: and
   they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.

   ^12And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the
   ark of the Lord.

   ^13And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the
   ark of the Lord went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and
   the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of
   the Lord, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.

   ^14And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into
   the camp: so they did six days.

   ^15And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about
   the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner
   seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.

   ^16And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with
   the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the Lord hath
   given you the city.

   ^17And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein,
   to the Lord: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are
   with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.

   ^18And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye
   make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make
   the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.

   ^19But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are
   consecrated unto the Lord: they shall come into the treasury of the
   Lord.

   ^20So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and
   it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and
   the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so
   that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him,
   and they took the city.

   ^21And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and
   woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the
   sword.

   ^22But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country,
   Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all
   that she hath, as ye sware unto her.

   ^23And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab,
   and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had;
   and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of
   Israel.

   ^24And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only
   the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they
   put into the treasury of the house of the Lord.

   ^25And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household,
   and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day;
   because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

   ^26And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man
   before the Lord, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he
   shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest
   son shall he set up the gates of it.

   ^27So the Lord was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all
   the country.

    Chapter 7

   But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing:
   for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the
   tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the Lord
   was kindled against the children of Israel.

   ^2And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on
   the east side of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view
   the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.

   ^3And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the
   people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite
   Ai; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but
   few.

   ^4So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and
   they fled before the men of Ai.

   ^5And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they
   chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in
   the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became
   as water.

   ^6And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face
   before the ark of the Lord until the eventide, he and the elders of
   Israel, and put dust upon their heads.

   ^7And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought
   this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites,
   to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other
   side Jordan!

   ^8O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before
   their enemies!

   ^9For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of
   it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth:
   and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?

   ^10And the Lord said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou
   thus upon thy face?

   ^11Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant
   which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing,
   and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even
   among their own stuff.

   ^12Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their
   enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were
   accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the
   accursed from among you.

   ^13Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to
   morrow: for thus saith the Lord God of Israel, There is an accursed
   thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine
   enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.

   ^14In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your
   tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the Lord taketh shall
   come according to the families thereof; and the family which the Lord
   shall take shall come by households; and the household which the Lord
   shall take shall come man by man.

   ^15And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall
   be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath
   transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and because he hath wrought
   folly in Israel.

   ^16So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their
   tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:

   ^17And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the
   Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and
   Zabdi was taken:

   ^18And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of
   Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was
   taken.

   ^19And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the
   Lord God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what
   thou hast done; hide it not from me.

   ^20And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against
   the Lord God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:

   ^21When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two
   hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight,
   then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the
   earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.

   ^22So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold,
   it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.

   ^23And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them
   unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out
   before the Lord.

   ^24And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,
   and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons,
   and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his
   tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of
   Achor.

   ^25And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the Lord shall trouble
   thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them
   with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.

   ^26And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So
   the Lord turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of
   that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.

    Chapter 8

   And the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take
   all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have
   given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and
   his land:

   ^2And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and
   her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take
   for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.

   ^3So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and
   Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them
   away by night.

   ^4And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against
   the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be
   ye all ready:

   ^5And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the
   city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at
   the first, that we will flee before them,

   ^6(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the
   city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first:
   therefore we will flee before them.

   ^7Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for
   the Lord your God will deliver it into your hand.

   ^8And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the
   city on fire: according to the commandment of the Lord shall ye do.
   See, I have commanded you.

   ^9Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and
   abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged
   that night among the people.

   ^10And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people,
   and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.

   ^11And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went
   up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north
   side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.

   ^12And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush
   between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

   ^13And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the
   north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city,
   Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.

   ^14And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted
   and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to
   battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain;
   but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the
   city.

   ^15And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them,
   and fled by the way of the wilderness.

   ^16And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue
   after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the
   city.

   ^17And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out
   after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.

   ^18And the Lord said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy
   hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua
   stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.

   ^19And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as
   soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city,
   and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.

   ^20And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold,
   the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to
   flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness
   turned back upon the pursuers.

   ^21And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the
   city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again,
   and slew the men of Ai.

   ^22And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in
   the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they
   smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.

   ^23And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.

   ^24And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the
   inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased
   them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until
   they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote
   it with the edge of the sword.

   ^25And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women,
   were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.

   ^26For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the
   spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.

   ^27Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey
   unto themselves, according unto the word of the Lord which he commanded
   Joshua.

   ^28And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation
   unto this day.

   ^29And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon
   as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase
   down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the
   city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto
   this day.

   ^30Then Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel in mount
   Ebal,

   ^31As Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of Israel,
   as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole
   stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered
   thereon burnt offerings unto the Lord, and sacrificed peace offerings.

   ^32And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which
   he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.

   ^33And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges,
   stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the
   Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, as well the
   stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against
   mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the
   servant of the Lord had commanded before, that they should bless the
   people of Israel.

   ^34And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and
   cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.

   ^35There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read
   not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the
   little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 9

   And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan,
   in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great
   sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite,
   the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;

   ^2That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with
   Israel, with one accord.

   ^3And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto
   Jericho and to Ai,

   ^4They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been
   ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles,
   old, and rent, and bound up;

   ^5And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon
   them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy.

   ^6And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him,
   and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore
   make ye a league with us.

   ^7And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell
   among us; and how shall we make a league with you?

   ^8And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto
   them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?

   ^9And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come
   because of the name of the Lord thy God: for we have heard the fame of
   him, and all that he did in Egypt,

   ^10And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were
   beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan,
   which was at Ashtaroth.

   ^11Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to
   us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet
   them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a
   league with us.

   ^12This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on
   the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and
   it is mouldy:

   ^13And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold,
   they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by
   reason of the very long journey.

   ^14And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the
   mouth of the Lord.

   ^15And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let
   them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.

   ^16And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a
   league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and
   that they dwelt among them.

   ^17And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on
   the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and
   Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.

   ^18And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of
   the congregation had sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel. And all
   the congregation murmured against the princes.

   ^19But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn
   unto them by the Lord God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch
   them.

   ^20This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be
   upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.

   ^21And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be
   hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the
   princes had promised them.

   ^22And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,
   Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when
   ye dwell among us?

   ^23Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed
   from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the
   house of my God.

   ^24And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told
   thy servants, how that the Lord thy God commanded his servant Moses to
   give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land
   from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of
   you, and have done this thing.

   ^25And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right
   unto thee to do unto us, do.

   ^26And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the
   children of Israel, that they slew them not.

   ^27And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water
   for the congregation, and for the altar of the Lord, even unto this
   day, in the place which he should choose.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 10

   Now it came to pass, when Adonizedek king of Jerusalem had heard how
   Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to
   Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the
   inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;

   ^2That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of
   the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men
   thereof were mighty.

   ^3Wherefore Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of
   Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of
   Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,

   ^4Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath
   made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.

   ^5Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the
   king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of
   Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their
   hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.

   ^6And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying,
   Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save
   us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the
   mountains are gathered together against us.

   ^7So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with
   him, and all the mighty men of valour.

   ^8And the Lord said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered
   them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.

   ^9Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all
   night.

   ^10And the Lord discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a
   great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up
   to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.

   ^11And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in
   the going down to Bethhoron, that the Lord cast down great stones from
   heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died
   with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the
   sword.

   ^12Then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up
   the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of
   Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the
   valley of Ajalon.

   ^13And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had
   avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book
   of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted
   not to go down about a whole day.

   ^14And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the Lord
   hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the Lord fought for Israel.

   ^15And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
   Gilgal.

   ^16But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.

   ^17And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a
   cave at Makkedah.

   ^18And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and
   set men by it for to keep them:

   ^19And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the
   hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the
   Lord your God hath delivered them into your hand.

   ^20And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made
   an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were
   consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced
   cities.

   ^21And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in
   peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.

   ^22Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those
   five kings unto me out of the cave.

   ^23And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of
   the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of
   Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.

   ^24And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua,
   that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the
   captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your
   feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their
   feet upon the necks of them.

   ^25And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and
   of good courage: for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies against
   whom ye fight.

   ^26And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on
   five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.

   ^27And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that
   Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them
   into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the
   cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.

   ^28And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the
   sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the
   souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of
   Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.

   ^29Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto
   Libnah, and fought against Libnah:

   ^30And the Lord delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand
   of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the
   souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the
   king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.

   ^31And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto
   Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:

   ^32And the Lord delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took
   it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all
   the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to
   Libnah.

   ^33Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote
   him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.

   ^34And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him;
   and they encamped against it, and fought against it:

   ^35And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the
   sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that
   day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.

   ^36And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron;
   and they fought against it:

   ^37And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the
   king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were
   therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to
   Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.

   ^38And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought
   against it:

   ^39And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof;
   and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed
   all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done
   to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done
   also to Libnah, and to her king.

   ^40So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and
   of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none
   remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord God of
   Israel commanded.

   ^41And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the
   country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.

   ^42And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,
   because the Lord God of Israel fought for Israel.

   ^43And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
   Gilgal.

    Chapter 11

   And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things,
   that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to
   the king of Achshaph,

   ^2And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the
   plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of
   Dor on the west,

   ^3And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite,
   and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains,
   and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.

   ^4And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people,
   even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses
   and chariots very many.

   ^5And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched
   together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.

   ^6And the Lord said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to
   morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel:
   thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.

   ^7So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by
   the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.

   ^8And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them,
   and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the
   valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them
   none remaining.

   ^9And Joshua did unto them as the Lord bade him: he houghed their
   horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.

   ^10And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the
   king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all
   those kingdoms.

   ^11And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the
   sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and
   he burnt Hazor with fire.

   ^12And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did
   Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly
   destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded.

   ^13But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel
   burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.

   ^14And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of
   Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with
   the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they
   any to breathe.

   ^15As the Lord commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command
   Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the Lord
   commanded Moses.

   ^16So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country,
   and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the
   mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;

   ^17Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad
   in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he
   took, and smote them, and slew them.

   ^18Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.

   ^19There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel,
   save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in
   battle.

   ^20For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should come
   against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that
   they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the Lord
   commanded Moses.

   ^21And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the
   mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the
   mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua
   destroyed them utterly with their cities.

   ^22There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of
   Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.

   ^23So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the Lord said
   unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according
   to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.

    Chapter 12

   Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel
   smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the
   rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the
   plain on the east:

   ^2Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from
   Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle
   of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, which
   is the border of the children of Ammon;

   ^3And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the
   sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to
   Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:

   ^4And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the
   giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,

   ^5And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto
   the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the
   border of Sihon king of Heshbon.

   ^6Them did Moses the servant of the Lord and the children of Israel
   smite: and Moses the servant of the Lord gave it for a possession unto
   the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.

   ^7And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children
   of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad in the
   valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir;
   which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according
   to their divisions;

   ^8In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the
   springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites,
   the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the
   Jebusites:

   ^9The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel,
   one;

   ^10The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;

   ^11The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

   ^12The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;

   ^13The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;

   ^14The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;

   ^15The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;

   ^16The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;

   ^17The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;

   ^18The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;

   ^19The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;

   ^20The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;

   ^21The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;

   ^22The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;

   ^23The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of
   Gilgal, one;

   ^24The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.

    Chapter 13

   Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the Lord said unto him,
   Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much
   land to be possessed.

   ^2This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the
   Philistines, and all Geshuri,

   ^3From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron
   northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the
   Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the
   Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:

   ^4From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is
   beside the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:

   ^5And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising,
   from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath.

   ^6All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto
   Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from
   before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the
   Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.

   ^7Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine
   tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,

   ^8With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their
   inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as
   Moses the servant of the Lord gave them;

   ^9From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city
   that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto
   Dibon;

   ^10And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in
   Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;

   ^11And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and
   all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;

   ^12All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in
   Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses
   smite, and cast them out.

   ^13Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor
   the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among
   the Israelites until this day.

   ^14Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices
   of the Lord God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he
   said unto them.

   ^15And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance
   according to their families.

   ^16And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river
   Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the
   plain by Medeba;

   ^17Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and
   Bamothbaal, and Beth-Baalmeon,

   ^18And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,

   ^19And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of the
   valley,

   ^20And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,

   ^21And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king
   of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the
   princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which
   were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.

   ^22Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of
   Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.

   ^23And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border
   thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their
   families, the cities and the villages thereof.

   ^24And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the
   children of Gad according to their families.

   ^25And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half
   the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah;

   ^26And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim
   unto the border of Debir;

   ^27And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and
   Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and
   his border, even unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other
   side Jordan eastward.

   ^28This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families,
   the cities, and their villages.

   ^29And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and this
   was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by
   their families.

   ^30And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og
   king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan,
   threescore cities:

   ^31And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of
   Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of
   Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their
   families.

   ^32These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance
   in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.

   ^33But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the Lord
   God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 14

   And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in
   the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of
   Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of
   Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.

   ^2By lot was their inheritance, as the Lord commanded by the hand of
   Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.

   ^3For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe
   on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance
   among them.

   ^4For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:
   therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities
   to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their
   substance.

   ^5As the Lord commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they
   divided the land.

   ^6Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the
   son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing
   that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in
   Kadeshbarnea.

   ^7Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from
   Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it
   was in mine heart.

   ^8Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the
   people melt: but I wholly followed the Lord my God.

   ^9And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet
   have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever,
   because thou hast wholly followed the Lord my God.

   ^10And now, behold, the Lord hath kept me alive, as he said, these
   forty and five years, even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses,
   while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I
   am this day fourscore and five years old.

   ^11As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent
   me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both
   to go out, and to come in.

   ^12Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the Lord spake in that
   day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that
   the cities were great and fenced: if so be the Lord will be with me,
   then I shall be able to drive them out, as the Lord said.

   ^13And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh
   Hebron for an inheritance.

   ^14Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of
   Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed
   the Lord God of Israel.

   ^15And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a
   great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 15

   This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their
   families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward
   was the uttermost part of the south coast.

   ^2And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the
   bay that looketh southward:

   ^3And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along
   to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed
   along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:

   ^4From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of
   Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be
   your south coast.

   ^5And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of Jordan.
   And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at
   the uttermost part of Jordan:

   ^6And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of
   Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of
   Reuben:

   ^7And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so
   northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to
   Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed
   toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at
   Enrogel:

   ^8And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the
   south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went
   up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom
   westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:

   ^9And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain
   of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron;
   and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim:

   ^10And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and
   passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the
   north side, and went down to Beth- shemesh, and passed on to Timnah:

   ^11And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the
   border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went
   out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.

   ^12And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof.
   This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to
   their families.

   ^13And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the
   children of Judah, according to the commandment of the Lord to Joshua,
   even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.

   ^14And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman,
   and Talmai, the children of Anak.

   ^15And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of
   Debir before was Kirjath- sepher.

   ^16And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him
   will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

   ^17And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he
   gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

   ^18And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask
   of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said unto
   her, What wouldest thou?

   ^19Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south
   land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs,
   and the nether springs.

   ^20This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
   according to their families.

   ^21And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
   toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,

   ^22And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,

   ^23And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,

   ^24Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,

   ^25And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor,

   ^26Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,

   ^27And Hazargaddah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet,

   ^28And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah,

   ^29Baalah, and Iim, and Azem,

   ^30And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,

   ^31And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,

   ^32And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are
   twenty and nine, with their villages:

   ^33And in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,

   ^34And Zanoah, and En- gannim, Tappuah, and Enam,

   ^35Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,

   ^36And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen
   cities with their villages:

   ^37Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad,

   ^38And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,

   ^39Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,

   ^40And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,

   ^41And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities
   with their villages:

   ^42Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,

   ^43And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,

   ^44And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their
   villages:

   ^45Ekron, with her towns and her villages:

   ^46From Ekron even unto the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with their
   villages:

   ^47Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her
   villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border
   thereof:

   ^48And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,

   ^49And Dannah, and Kirjathsannah, which is Debir,

   ^50And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,

   ^51And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages:

   ^52Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,

   ^53And Janum, and Bethtappuah, and Aphekah,

   ^54And Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, and Zior; nine cities
   with their villages:

   ^55Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,

   ^56And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,

   ^57Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages:

   ^58Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor,

   ^59And Maarath, and Bethanoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their
   villages:

   ^60Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities with
   their villages:

   ^61In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,

   ^62And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with their
   villages.

   ^63As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of
   Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the
   children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 16

   And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, unto
   the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from
   Jericho throughout mount Bethel,

   ^2And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders
   of Archi to Ataroth,

   ^3And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of
   Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer: and the goings out thereof are at
   the sea.

   ^4So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their
   inheritance.

   ^5And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families
   was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was
   Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper;

   ^6And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north
   side; and the border went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passed
   by it on the east to Janohah;

   ^7And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to
   Jericho, and went out at Jordan.

   ^8The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and
   the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the
   tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.

   ^9And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the
   inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their
   villages.

   ^10And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the
   Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under
   tribute.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 17

   There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the
   firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the
   father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead
   and Bashan.

   ^2There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by
   their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of
   Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem,
   and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these
   were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.

   ^3But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of
   Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are
   the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and
   Tirzah.

   ^4And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the
   son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The Lord commanded Moses to
   give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the
   commandment of the Lord he gave them an inheritance among the brethren
   of their father.

   ^5And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead
   and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;

   ^6Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons:
   and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.

   ^7And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth
   before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the
   inhabitants of Entappuah.

   ^8Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of
   Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;

   ^9And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river:
   these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of
   Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of
   it were at the sea:

   ^10Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's, and the
   sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in
   Issachar on the east.

   ^11And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns,
   and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and
   the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach
   and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three
   countries.

   ^12Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of
   those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.

   ^13Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong,
   that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them
   out.

   ^14And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou
   given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great
   people, forasmuch as the Lord hath blessed me hitherto?

   ^15And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get thee
   up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of
   the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for
   thee.

   ^16And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and
   all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots
   of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and they who are
   of the valley of Jezreel.

   ^17And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to
   Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou
   shalt not have one lot only:

   ^18But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt
   cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt
   drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though
   they be strong.

    Chapter 18

   And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together
   at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the
   land was subdued before them.

   ^2And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which
   had not yet received their inheritance.

   ^3And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to
   go to possess the land, which the Lord God of your fathers hath given
   you?

   ^4Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will send
   them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it
   according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to me.

   ^5And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their
   coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts
   on the north.

   ^6Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the
   description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the
   Lord our God.

   ^7But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the
   Lord is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of
   Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east,
   which Moses the servant of the Lord gave them.

   ^8And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went
   to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and
   describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you
   before the Lord in Shiloh.

   ^9And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by
   cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the host
   at Shiloh.

   ^10And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the Lord: and there
   Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their
   divisions.

   ^11And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
   according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth
   between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.

   ^12And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border
   went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through
   the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the
   wilderness of Bethaven.

   ^13And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz,
   which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar,
   near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether Bethhoron.

   ^14And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the sea
   southward, from the hill that lieth before Beth- horon southward; and
   the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjath- jearim, a
   city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter.

   ^15And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the
   border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of
   Nephtoah:

   ^16And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth
   before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of
   the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the
   side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,

   ^17And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and went
   forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adummim,
   and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,

   ^18And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and
   went down unto Arabah:

   ^19And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward: and
   the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at
   the south end of Jordan: this was the south coast.

   ^20And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the
   inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round
   about, according to their families.

   ^21Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to
   their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz,

   ^22And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,

   ^23And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah,

   ^24And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their
   villages:

   ^25Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,

   ^26And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,

   ^27And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,

   ^28And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and
   Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance
   of the children of Benjamin according to their families.

    Chapter 19

   And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the
   children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance
   was within the inheritance of the children of Judah.

   ^2And they had in their inheritance Beersheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,

   ^3And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem,

   ^4And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,

   ^5And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah,

   ^6And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their villages:

   ^7Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their villages:

   ^8And all the villages that were round about these cities to
   Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of the tribe
   of the children of Simeon according to their families.

   ^9Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of
   the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was too
   much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance
   within the inheritance of them.

   ^10And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to
   their families: and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid:

   ^11And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to
   Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before Jokneam;

   ^12And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border
   of Chislothtabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and goeth up to
   Japhia,

   ^13And from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittahhepher, to
   Ittahkazin, and goeth out to Remmonmethoar to Neah;

   ^14And the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon: and the
   outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthahel:

   ^15And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem:
   twelve cities with their villages.

   ^16This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to
   their families, these cities with their villages.

   ^17And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of
   Issachar according to their families.

   ^18And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,

   ^19And Hapharaim, and Shion, and Anaharath,

   ^20And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,

   ^21And Remeth, and Engannim, and Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez;

   ^22And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh;
   and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixteen cities with
   their villages.

   ^23This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar
   according to their families, the cities and their villages.

   ^24And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher
   according to their families.

   ^25And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,

   ^26And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel
   westward, and to Shihorlibnath;

   ^27And turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon, and reacheth to
   Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of
   Bethemek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand,

   ^28And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great Zidon;

   ^29And then the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre;
   and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings thereof are at the
   sea from the coast to Achzib:

   ^30Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their
   villages.

   ^31This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher
   according to their families, these cities with their villages.

   ^32The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for the
   children of Naphtali according to their families.

   ^33And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami,
   Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings thereof were at
   Jordan:

   ^34And then the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor, and goeth out
   from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the south side, and
   reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon Jordan toward the
   sunrising.

   ^35And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and
   Chinnereth,

   ^36And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,

   ^37And Kedesh, and Edrei, and Enhazor,

   ^38And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and Bethanath, and Bethshemesh;
   nineteen cities with their villages.

   ^39This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali
   according to their families, the cities and their villages.

   ^40And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan
   according to their families.

   ^41And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and
   Irshemesh,

   ^42And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,

   ^43And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,

   ^44And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,

   ^45And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon,

   ^46And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.

   ^47And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them:
   therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took
   it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and
   dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their
   father.

   ^48This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan
   according to their families, these cities with their villages.

   ^49When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by
   their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the
   son of Nun among them:

   ^50According to the word of the Lord they gave him the city which he
   asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and
   dwelt therein.

   ^51These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the
   son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children
   of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the Lord,
   at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end
   of dividing the country.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 20

   The Lord also spake unto Joshua, saying,

   ^2Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities
   of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses:

   ^3That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may
   flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood.

   ^4And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at
   the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in
   the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city
   unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.

   ^5And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not
   deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour
   unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.

   ^6And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the
   congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that
   shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his
   own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.

   ^7And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem
   in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of
   Judah.

   ^8And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer
   in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth
   in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe
   of Manasseh.

   ^9These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and
   for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth any
   person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the
   avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation.

    Chapter 21

   Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto Eleazar the
   priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of the
   fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel;

   ^2And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The
   Lord commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with
   the suburbs thereof for our cattle.

   ^3And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their
   inheritance, at the commandment of the Lord, these cities and their
   suburbs.

   ^4And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the
   children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites, had by lot out
   of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the
   tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.

   ^5And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families
   of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the
   half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.

   ^6And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the
   tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe
   of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen
   cities.

   ^7The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of
   Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun,
   twelve cities.

   ^8And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities
   with their suburbs, as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses.

   ^9And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of
   the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here
   mentioned by name,

   ^10Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the
   Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs was the
   first lot.

   ^11And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city
   is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round
   about it.

   ^12But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to
   Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.

   ^13Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her
   suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with her
   suburbs,

   ^14And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,

   ^15And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,

   ^16And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and
   Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.

   ^17And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with
   her suburbs,

   ^18Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities.

   ^19All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen
   cities with their suburbs.

   ^20And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which
   remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their
   lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.

   ^21For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, to be
   a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs,

   ^22And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs; four
   cities.

   ^23And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon
   with her suburbs,

   ^24Aijalon with her suburbs, Gath- rimmon with her suburbs; four
   cities.

   ^25And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbs, and
   Gathrimmon with her suburbs; two cities.

   ^26All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of the
   children of Kohath that remained.

   ^27And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites,
   out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with
   her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Beeshterah with
   her suburbs; two cities.

   ^28And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs, Dabareh
   with her suburbs,

   ^29Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannim with her suburbs; four cities.

   ^30And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon with
   her suburbs,

   ^31Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four cities.

   ^32And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her
   suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor with her
   suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.

   ^33All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were
   thirteen cities with their suburbs.

   ^34And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the
   Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and
   Kartah with her suburbs,

   ^35Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four cities.

   ^36And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jahazah
   with her suburbs,

   ^37Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four
   cities.

   ^38And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs, to
   be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with her suburbs,

   ^39Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in
   all.

   ^40So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families,
   which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lot
   twelve cities.

   ^41All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children
   of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs.

   ^42These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them:
   thus were all these cities.

   ^43And the Lord gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give
   unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein.

   ^44And the Lord gave them rest round about, according to all that he
   sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their
   enemies before them; the Lord delivered all their enemies into their
   hand.

   ^45There failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord had spoken
   unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 22

   Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe
   of Manasseh,

   ^2And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the
   Lord commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded
   you:

   ^3Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but
   have kept the charge of the commandment of the Lord your God.

   ^4And now the Lord your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he
   promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents,
   and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the
   Lord gave you on the other side Jordan.

   ^5But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses
   the servant of the Lord charged you, to love the Lord your God, and to
   walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto
   him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.

   ^6So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their
   tents.

   ^7Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given
   possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among
   their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them
   away also unto their tents, then he blessed them,

   ^8And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your
   tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with
   brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of
   your enemies with your brethren.

   ^9And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe
   of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of
   Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of
   Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed,
   according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses.

   ^10And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land
   of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half
   tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see
   to.

   ^11And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben
   and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an
   altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the
   passage of the children of Israel.

   ^12And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation
   of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go
   up to war against them.

   ^13And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to
   the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land
   of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,

   ^14And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout
   all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of
   their fathers among the thousands of Israel.

   ^15And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of
   Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and
   they spake with them, saying,

   ^16Thus saith the whole congregation of the Lord, What trespass is this
   that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day
   from following the Lord, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye
   might rebel this day against the Lord?

   ^17Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not
   cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the
   congregation of the Lord,

   ^18But that ye must turn away this day from following the Lord? and it
   will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the Lord, that to morrow he
   will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.

   ^19Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then
   pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the Lord, wherein the
   Lord'S tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not
   against the Lord, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside
   the altar of the Lord our God.

   ^20Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed
   thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man
   perished not alone in his iniquity.

   ^21Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half
   tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of
   Israel,

   ^22The Lord God of gods, the Lord God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel
   he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against
   the Lord, (save us not this day,)

   ^23That we have built us an altar to turn from following the Lord, or
   if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer
   peace offerings thereon, let the Lord himself require it;

   ^24And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In
   time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What
   have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel?

   ^25For the Lord hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye
   children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the Lord: so
   shall your children make our children cease from fearing the Lord.

   ^26Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for
   burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:

   ^27But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our
   generations after us, that we might do the service of the Lord before
   him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our
   peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time
   to come, Ye have no part in the Lord.

   ^28Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us
   or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold
   the pattern of the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for
   burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and
   you.

   ^29God forbid that we should rebel against the Lord, and turn this day
   from following the Lord, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for
   meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the Lord our God
   that is before his tabernacle.

   ^30And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation
   and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the
   words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
   children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.

   ^31And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of
   Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh,
   This day we perceive that the Lord is among us, because ye have not
   committed this trespass against the Lord: now ye have delivered the
   children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord.

   ^32And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
   returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out
   of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of
   Israel, and brought them word again.

   ^33And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of
   Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle,
   to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.

   ^34And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar
   Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the Lord is God.

    Chapter 23

   And it came to pass a long time after that the Lord had given rest unto
   Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old and
   stricken in age.

   ^2And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and for their
   heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto
   them, I am old and stricken in age:

   ^3And ye have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto all these
   nations because of you; for the Lord your God is he that hath fought
   for you.

   ^4Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to
   be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations
   that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.

   ^5And the Lord your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive
   them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the
   Lord your God hath promised unto you.

   ^6Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written
   in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to
   the right hand or to the left;

   ^7That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;
   neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by
   them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:

   ^8But cleave unto the Lord your God, as ye have done unto this day.

   ^9For the Lord hath driven out from before you great nations and
   strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto
   this day.

   ^10One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the Lord your God, he it
   is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.

   ^11Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the Lord your
   God.

   ^12Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of
   these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make
   marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:

   ^13Know for a certainty that the Lord your God will no more drive out
   any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and
   traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes,
   until ye perish from off this good land which the Lord your God hath
   given you.

   ^14And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye
   know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath
   failed of all the good things which the Lord your God spake concerning
   you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed
   thereof.

   ^15Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come
   upon you, which the Lord your God promised you; so shall the Lord bring
   upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this
   good land which the Lord your God hath given you.

   ^16When ye have transgressed the covenant of the Lord your God, which
   he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed
   yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the Lord be kindled against
   you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath
   given unto you.

    Chapter 24

   And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for
   the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and
   for their officers; and they presented themselves before God.

   ^2And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the Lord God of
   Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time,
   even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they
   served other gods.

   ^3And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and
   led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and
   gave him Isaac.

   ^4And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount
   Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.

   ^5I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that
   which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.

   ^6And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea;
   and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen
   unto the Red sea.

   ^7And when they cried unto the Lord, he put darkness between you and
   the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and
   your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the
   wilderness a long season.

   ^8And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the
   other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your
   hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from
   before you.

   ^9Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against
   Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you:

   ^10But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still:
   so I delivered you out of his hand.

   ^11And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of
   Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the
   Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the
   Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.

   ^12And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before
   you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor
   with thy bow.

   ^13And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities
   which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and
   oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.

   ^14Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in sincerity and in
   truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other
   side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the Lord.

   ^15And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day
   whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that
   were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in
   whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the
   Lord.

   ^16And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake
   the Lord, to serve other gods;

   ^17For the Lord our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers
   out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did
   those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein
   we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:

   ^18And the Lord drave out from before us all the people, even the
   Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the
   Lord; for he is our God.

   ^19And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the Lord: for he is
   an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your
   transgressions nor your sins.

   ^20If ye forsake the Lord, and serve strange gods, then he will turn
   and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.

   ^21And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the Lord.

   ^22And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves
   that ye have chosen you the Lord, to serve him. And they said, We are
   witnesses.

   ^23Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among
   you, and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel.

   ^24And the people said unto Joshua, The Lord our God will we serve, and
   his voice will we obey.

   ^25So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a
   statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

   ^26And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took
   a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the
   sanctuary of the Lord.

   ^27And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a
   witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the Lord which he
   spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny
   your God.

   ^28So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.

   ^29And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun,
   the servant of the Lord, died, being an hundred and ten years old.

   ^30And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
   Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill
   of Gaash.

   ^31And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days
   of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works
   of the Lord, that he had done for Israel.

   ^32And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out
   of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob
   bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces
   of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.

   ^33And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill
   that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount
   Ephraim.

    Chapter 1

   Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of
   Israel asked the Lord, saying, Who shall go up for us against the
   Canaanites first, to fight against them?

   ^2And the Lord said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the
   land into his hand.

   ^3And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot,
   that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with
   thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.

   ^4And Judah went up; and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the
   Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand
   men.

   ^5And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and
   they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.

   ^6But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and
   cut off his thumbs and his great toes.

   ^7And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs
   and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I
   have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem,
   and there he died.

   ^8Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken
   it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on
   fire.

   ^9And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the
   Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the
   valley.

   ^10And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the
   name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and
   Ahiman, and Talmai.

   ^11And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the
   name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:

   ^12And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him
   will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

   ^13And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and
   he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

   ^14And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask
   of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said
   unto her, What wilt thou?

   ^15And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a
   south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper
   springs and the nether springs.

   ^16And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of
   the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness
   of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt
   among the people.

   ^17And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites
   that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the
   city was called Hormah.

   ^18Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the
   coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.

   ^19And the Lord was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the
   mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley,
   because they had chariots of iron.

   ^20And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled
   thence the three sons of Anak.

   ^21And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that
   inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of
   Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.

   ^22And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the
   Lord was with them.

   ^23And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the
   city before was Luz.)

   ^24And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said
   unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we
   will shew thee mercy.

   ^25And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the
   city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his
   family.

   ^26And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city,
   and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this
   day.

   ^27Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her
   towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her
   towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants
   of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.

   ^28And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the
   Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.

   ^29Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer;
   but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.

   ^30Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the
   inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became
   tributaries.

   ^31Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
   inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor
   of Aphik, nor of Rehob:

   ^32But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the
   land: for they did not drive them out.

   ^33Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor
   the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the
   inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh
   and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.

   ^34And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for
   they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:

   ^35But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in
   Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they
   became tributaries.

   ^36And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim,
   from the rock, and upward.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 2

   And an angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I
   made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land
   which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my
   covenant with you.

   ^2And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye
   shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why
   have ye done this?

   ^3Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but
   they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare
   unto you.

   ^4And it came to pass, when the angel of the Lord spake these words
   unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice,
   and wept.

   ^5And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed
   there unto the Lord.

   ^6And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went
   every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.

   ^7And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the
   days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great
   works of the Lord, that he did for Israel.

   ^8And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being an
   hundred and ten years old.

   ^9And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres,
   in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash.

   ^10And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and
   there arose another generation after them, which knew not the Lord, nor
   yet the works which he had done for Israel.

   ^11And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and
   served Baalim:

   ^12And they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, which brought them
   out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the
   people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and
   provoked the Lord to anger.

   ^13And they forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.

   ^14And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he delivered
   them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them
   into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any
   longer stand before their enemies.

   ^15Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them
   for evil, as the Lord had said, and as the Lord had sworn unto them:
   and they were greatly distressed.

   ^16Nevertheless the Lord raised up judges, which delivered them out of
   the hand of those that spoiled them.

   ^17And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a
   whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned
   quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the
   commandments of the Lord; but they did not so.

   ^18And when the Lord raised them up judges, then the Lord was with the
   judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days
   of the judge: for it repented the Lord because of their groanings by
   reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.

   ^19And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned,
   and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other
   gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from
   their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.

   ^20And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel; and he said,
   Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I
   commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;

   ^21I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the
   nations which Joshua left when he died:

   ^22That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way
   of the Lord to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.

   ^23Therefore the Lord left those nations, without driving them out
   hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 3

   Now these are the nations which the Lord left, to prove Israel by them,
   even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;

   ^2Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to
   teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;

   ^3Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and
   the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount
   Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.

   ^4And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would
   hearken unto the commandments of the Lord, which he commanded their
   fathers by the hand of Moses.

   ^5And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and
   Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:

   ^6And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their
   daughters to their sons, and served their gods.

   ^7And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and
   forgat the Lord their God, and served Baalim and the groves.

   ^8Therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he sold
   them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the
   children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.

   ^9And when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised
   up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even
   Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.

   ^10And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel, and
   went out to war: and the Lord delivered Chushanrishathaim king of
   Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against
   Chushanrishathaim.

   ^11And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz
   died.

   ^12And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord:
   and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel,
   because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord.

   ^13And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went
   and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.

   ^14So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen
   years.

   ^15But when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised
   them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man
   lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon
   the king of Moab.

   ^16But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length;
   and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.

   ^17And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a
   very fat man.

   ^18And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the
   people that bare the present.

   ^19But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal,
   and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep
   silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.

   ^20And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour,
   which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from
   God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.

   ^21And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right
   thigh, and thrust it into his belly:

   ^22And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon
   the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and
   the dirt came out.

   ^23Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the
   parlour upon him, and locked them.

   ^24When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that,
   behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he
   covereth his feet in his summer chamber.

   ^25And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not
   the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them:
   and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.

   ^26And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries,
   and escaped unto Seirath.

   ^27And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the
   mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from
   the mount, and he before them.

   ^28And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the Lord hath delivered
   your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him,
   and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to
   pass over.

   ^29And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all
   lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.

   ^30So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land
   had rest fourscore years.

   ^31And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the
   Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered
   Israel.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 4

   And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord,
   when Ehud was dead.

   ^2And the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that
   reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in
   Harosheth of the Gentiles.

   ^3And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord: for he had nine
   hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the
   children of Israel.

   ^4And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at
   that time.

   ^5And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel
   in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for
   judgment.

   ^6And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
   Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the Lord God of Israel
   commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee
   ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of
   Zebulun?

   ^7And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of
   Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver
   him into thine hand.

   ^8And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but
   if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.

   ^9And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey
   that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the Lord shall sell
   Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak
   to Kedesh.

   ^10And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with
   ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.

   ^11Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father
   in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his
   tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.

   ^12And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to
   mount Tabor.

   ^13And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred
   chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth
   of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.

   ^14And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the
   Lord hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the Lord gone out
   before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men
   after him.

   ^15And the Lord discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his
   host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted
   down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.

   ^16But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto
   Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the
   edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.

   ^17Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of
   Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor
   and the house of Heber the Kenite.

   ^18And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my
   lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into
   the tent, she covered him with a mantle.

   ^19And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink;
   for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink,
   and covered him.

   ^20Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall
   be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any
   man here? that thou shalt say, No.

   ^21Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer
   in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his
   temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and
   weary. So he died.

   ^22And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and
   said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest.
   And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail
   was in his temples.

   ^23So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the
   children of Israel.

   ^24And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed
   against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king
   of Canaan.

    Chapter 5

   Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,

   ^2Praise ye the Lord for the avenging of Israel, when the people
   willingly offered themselves.

   ^3Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto
   the Lord; I will sing praise to the Lord God of Israel.

   ^4Lord, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the
   field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds
   also dropped water.

   ^5The mountains melted from before the Lord, even that Sinai from
   before the Lord God of Israel.

   ^6In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the
   highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.

   ^7The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until
   that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.

   ^8They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or
   spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?

   ^9My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves
   willingly among the people. Bless ye the Lord.

   ^10Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and
   walk by the way.

   ^11They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of
   drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the
   Lord, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in
   Israel: then shall the people of the Lord go down to the gates.

   ^12Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and
   lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.

   ^13Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among
   the people: the Lord made me have dominion over the mighty.

   ^14Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee,
   Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out
   of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.

   ^15And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and
   also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of
   Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.

   ^16Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the
   flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of
   heart.

   ^17Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher
   continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.

   ^18Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto
   the death in the high places of the field.

   ^19The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in
   Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.

   ^20They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against
   Sisera.

   ^21The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river
   Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.

   ^22Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the
   pransings of their mighty ones.

   ^23Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the Lord, curse ye bitterly the
   inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the Lord, to
   the help of the Lord against the mighty.

   ^24Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be,
   blessed shall she be above women in the tent.

   ^25He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a
   lordly dish.

   ^26She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's
   hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head,
   when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.

   ^27At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he
   fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.

   ^28The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the
   lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of
   his chariots?

   ^29Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,

   ^30Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a
   damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers
   colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides,
   meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?

   ^31So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord: but let them that love him
   be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest
   forty years.

    Chapter 6

   And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord: and the
   Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.

   ^2And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the
   Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the
   mountains, and caves, and strong holds.

   ^3And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and
   the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against
   them;

   ^4And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the
   earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel,
   neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.

   ^5For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as
   grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without
   number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.

   ^6And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and
   the children of Israel cried unto the Lord.

   ^7And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord
   because of the Midianites,

   ^8That the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said
   unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I brought you up from
   Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;

   ^9And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the
   hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and
   gave you their land;

   ^10And I said unto you, I am the Lord your God; fear not the gods of
   the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.

   ^11And there came an angel of the Lord, and sat under an oak which was
   in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon
   threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.

   ^12And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and said unto him, The
   Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.

   ^13And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why
   then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our
   fathers told us of, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?
   but now the Lord hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of
   the Midianites.

   ^14And the Lord looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and
   thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent
   thee?

   ^15And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel?
   behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my
   father's house.

   ^16And the Lord said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou
   shalt smite the Midianites as one man.

   ^17And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then
   shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.

   ^18Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring
   forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry
   until thou come again.

   ^19And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an
   ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a
   pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.

   ^20And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the
   unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth.
   And he did so.

   ^21Then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was
   in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there
   rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened
   cakes. Then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight.

   ^22And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord, Gideon
   said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the Lord
   face to face.

   ^23And the Lord said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt
   not die.

   ^24Then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord, and called it
   Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.

   ^25And it came to pass the same night, that the Lord said unto him,
   Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years
   old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut
   down the grove that is by it:

   ^26And build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this rock,
   in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt
   sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.

   ^27Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the Lord had
   said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household,
   and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it
   by night.

   ^28And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the
   altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it,
   and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.

   ^29And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when
   they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done
   this thing.

   ^30Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he
   may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he
   hath cut down the grove that was by it.

   ^31And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for
   Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to
   death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for
   himself, because one hath cast down his altar.

   ^32Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal
   plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.

   ^33Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the
   east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley
   of Jezreel.

   ^34But the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet;
   and Abiezer was gathered after him.

   ^35And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was
   gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto
   Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.

   ^36And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as
   thou hast said,

   ^37Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be
   on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall
   I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.

   ^38And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the
   fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of
   water.

   ^39And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and
   I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once
   with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all
   the ground let there be dew.

   ^40And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and
   there was dew on all the ground.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 7

   Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him,
   rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host
   of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh,
   in the valley.

   ^2And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too
   many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt
   themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.

   ^3Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying,
   Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from
   mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand;
   and there remained ten thousand.

   ^4And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring
   them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it
   shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the
   same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall
   not go with thee, the same shall not go.

   ^5So he brought down the people unto the water: and the Lord said unto
   Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog
   lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth
   down upon his knees to drink.

   ^6And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their
   mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed
   down upon their knees to drink water.

   ^7And the Lord said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped
   will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let
   all the other people go every man unto his place.

   ^8So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he
   sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those
   three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the
   valley.

   ^9And it came to pass the same night, that the Lord said unto him,
   Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine
   hand.

   ^10But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to
   the host:

   ^11And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands
   be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah
   his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.

   ^12And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the
   east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their
   camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.

   ^13And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream
   unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake
   of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent,
   and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.

   ^14And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the
   sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand
   hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.

   ^15And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the
   interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host
   of Israel, and said, Arise; for the Lord hath delivered into your hand
   the host of Midian.

   ^16And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he
   put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps
   within the pitchers.

   ^17And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold,
   when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so
   shall ye do.

   ^18When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye
   the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of
   the Lord, and of Gideon.

   ^19So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the
   outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had
   but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the
   pitchers that were in their hands.

   ^20And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers,
   and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right
   hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the Lord, and of
   Gideon.

   ^21And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all
   the host ran, and cried, and fled.

   ^22And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the Lord set every
   man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the
   host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah,
   unto Tabbath.

   ^23And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali,
   and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the
   Midianites.

   ^24And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying,
   Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto
   Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves
   together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.

   ^25And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they
   slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of
   Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to
   Gideon on the other side Jordan.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 8

   And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus,
   that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the
   Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.

   ^2And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is
   not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of
   Abiezer?

   ^3God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and
   Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger
   was abated toward him, when he had said that.

   ^4And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred
   men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.

   ^5And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of
   bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am
   pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.

   ^6And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna
   now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?

   ^7And Gideon said, Therefore when the Lord hath delivered Zebah and
   Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of
   the wilderness and with briers.

   ^8And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and
   the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.

   ^9And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again
   in peace, I will break down this tower.

   ^10Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them,
   about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the
   children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men
   that drew sword.

   ^11And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the
   east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was
   secure.

   ^12And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took
   the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the
   host.

   ^13And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was
   up,

   ^14And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him:
   and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders
   thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.

   ^15And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and
   Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah
   and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men
   that are weary?

   ^16And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and
   briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.

   ^17And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.

   ^18Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they
   whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they;
   each one resembled the children of a king.

   ^19And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as
   the Lord liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.

   ^20And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the
   youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.

   ^21Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as
   the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and
   Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks.

   ^22Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both
   thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us
   from the hand of Midian.

   ^23And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall
   my son rule over you: the Lord shall rule over you.

   ^24And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye
   would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden
   earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)

   ^25And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a
   garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.

   ^26And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a
   thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and
   collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside
   the chains that were about their camels' necks.

   ^27And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in
   Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing
   became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.

   ^28Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they
   lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty
   years in the days of Gideon.

   ^29And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.

   ^30And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he
   had many wives.

   ^31And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son,
   whose name he called Abimelech.

   ^32And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried
   in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.

   ^33And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children
   of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made
   Baalberith their god.

   ^34And the children of Israel remembered not the Lord their God, who
   had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:

   ^35Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely,
   Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 9

   And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's
   brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house
   of his mother's father, saying,

   ^2Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is
   better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are
   threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you?
   remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.

   ^3And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of
   Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech;
   for they said, He is our brother.

   ^4And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the
   house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons,
   which followed him.

   ^5And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren
   the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one
   stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was
   left; for he hid himself.

   ^6And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of
   Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar
   that was in Shechem.

   ^7And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of
   mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them,
   Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.

   ^8The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they
   said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.

   ^9But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,
   wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the
   trees?

   ^10And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.

   ^11But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and
   my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?

   ^12Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.

   ^13And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth
   God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?

   ^14Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over
   us.

   ^15And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king
   over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let
   fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.

   ^16Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have
   made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his
   house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands;

   ^17(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and
   delivered you out of the hand of Midian:

   ^18And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have
   slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have
   made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of
   Shechem, because he is your brother;)

   ^19If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with
   his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also
   rejoice in you:

   ^20But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of
   Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of
   Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.

   ^21And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there,
   for fear of Abimelech his brother.

   ^22When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,

   ^23Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of
   Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:

   ^24That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal
   might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which
   slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing
   of his brethren.

   ^25And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the
   mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it
   was told Abimelech.

   ^26And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to
   Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.

   ^27And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and
   trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god,
   and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.

   ^28And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem,
   that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his
   officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should
   we serve him?

   ^29And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove
   Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.

   ^30And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son
   of Ebed, his anger was kindled.

   ^31And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal
   the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they
   fortify the city against thee.

   ^32Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee,
   and lie in wait in the field:

   ^33And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou
   shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the
   people that is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to
   them as thou shalt find occasion.

   ^34And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by
   night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.

   ^35And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the
   gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with
   him, from lying in wait.

   ^36And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come
   people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him,
   Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.

   ^37And Gaal spake again and said, See there come people down by the
   middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of
   Meonenim.

   ^38Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou
   saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the
   people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with
   them.

   ^39And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with
   Abimelech.

   ^40And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were
   overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.

   ^41And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his
   brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.

   ^42And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the
   field; and they told Abimelech.

   ^43And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and
   laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come
   forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.

   ^44And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward,
   and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other
   companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew
   them.

   ^45And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the
   city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and
   sowed it with salt.

   ^46And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they
   entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.

   ^47And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem
   were gathered together.

   ^48And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that
   were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a
   bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and
   said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make
   haste, and do as I have done.

   ^49And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and
   followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire
   upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about
   a thousand men and women.

   ^50Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took
   it.

   ^51But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all
   the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and
   gat them up to the top of the tower.

   ^52And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went
   hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.

   ^53And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's
   head, and all to brake his skull.

   ^54Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said
   unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman
   slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.

   ^55And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they
   departed every man unto his place.

   ^56Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his
   father, in slaying his seventy brethren:

   ^57And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their
   heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.

    Chapter 10

   And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah,
   the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount
   Ephraim.

   ^2And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried
   in Shamir.

   ^3And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and
   two years.

   ^4And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had
   thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which are in
   the land of Gilead.

   ^5And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.

   ^6And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord,
   and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods
   of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon,
   and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the Lord, and served not
   him.

   ^7And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he sold them
   into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children
   of Ammon.

   ^8And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel:
   eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side
   Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.

   ^9Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also
   against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim;
   so that Israel was sore distressed.

   ^10And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, saying, We have
   sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also
   served Baalim.

   ^11And the Lord said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you
   from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon,
   and from the Philistines?

   ^12The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did
   oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.

   ^13Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will
   deliver you no more.

   ^14Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you
   in the time of your tribulation.

   ^15And the children of Israel said unto the Lord, We have sinned: do
   thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we
   pray thee, this day.

   ^16And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the
   Lord: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.

   ^17Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in
   Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and
   encamped in Mizpeh.

   ^18And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man
   is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall
   be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

    Chapter 11

   Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the
   son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.

   ^2And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and
   they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in
   our father's house; for thou art the son of a strange woman.

   ^3Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob:
   and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.

   ^4And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon
   made war against Israel.

   ^5And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against
   Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of
   Tob:

   ^6And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may
   fight with the children of Ammon.

   ^7And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and
   expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when
   ye are in distress?

   ^8And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again
   to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the
   children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

   ^9And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home
   again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the Lord deliver them
   before me, shall I be your head?

   ^10And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The Lord be witness
   between us, if we do not so according to thy words.

   ^11Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made
   him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words
   before the Lord in Mizpeh.

   ^12And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon,
   saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to
   fight in my land?

   ^13And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers
   of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of
   Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore
   restore those lands again peaceably.

   ^14And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of
   Ammon:

   ^15And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the
   land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:

   ^16But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the
   wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;

   ^17Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I
   pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not
   hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab:
   but he would not consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh.

   ^18Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land
   of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of
   Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the
   border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.

   ^19And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king
   of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee,
   through thy land into my place.

   ^20But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon
   gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought
   against Israel.

   ^21And the Lord God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into
   the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the
   land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.

   ^22And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even
   unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.

   ^23So now the Lord God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from
   before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?

   ^24Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to
   possess? So whomsoever the Lord our God shall drive out from before us,
   them will we possess.

   ^25And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king
   of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight
   against them,

   ^26While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her
   towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon,
   three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that
   time?

   ^27Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to
   war against me: the Lord the Judge be judge this day between the
   children of Israel and the children of Ammon.

   ^28Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the
   words of Jephthah which he sent him.

   ^29Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah, and he passed over
   Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh
   of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.

   ^30And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou shalt
   without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,

   ^31Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my
   house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon,
   shall surely be the Lord'S, and I will offer it up for a burnt
   offering.

   ^32So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against
   them; and the Lord delivered them into his hands.

   ^33And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even
   twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great
   slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children
   of Israel.

   ^34And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his
   daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she
   was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.

   ^35And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and
   said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art
   one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the Lord,
   and I cannot go back.

   ^36And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto
   the Lord, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy
   mouth; forasmuch as the Lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine
   enemies, even of the children of Ammon.

   ^37And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me
   alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and
   bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.

   ^38And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went
   with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.

   ^39And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto
   her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed:
   and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,

   ^40That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of
   Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 12

   And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went
   northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to
   fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with
   thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.

   ^2And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife
   with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not
   out of their hands.

   ^3And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands,
   and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the Lord delivered
   them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to
   fight against me?

   ^4Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought
   with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said,
   Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among
   the Manassites.

   ^5And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the
   Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were
   escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art
   thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;

   ^6Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth:
   for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and
   slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the
   Ephraimites forty and two thousand.

   ^7And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the
   Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.

   ^8And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.

   ^9And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad,
   and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged
   Israel seven years.

   ^10Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.

   ^11And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged
   Israel ten years.

   ^12And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the
   country of Zebulun.

   ^13And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.

   ^14And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore
   and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.

   ^15And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in
   Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 13

   And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord; and
   the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.

   ^2And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites,
   whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.

   ^3And the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman, and said unto her,
   Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive,
   and bear a son.

   ^4Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong
   drink, and eat not any unclean thing:

   ^5For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come
   on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb:
   and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the
   Philistines.

   ^6Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came
   unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of
   God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he
   me his name:

   ^7But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and
   now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for
   the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his
   death.

   ^8Then Manoah intreated the Lord, and said, O my Lord, let the man of
   God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we
   shall do unto the child that shall be born.

   ^9And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came
   again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband
   was not with her.

   ^10And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said
   unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the
   other day.

   ^11And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and
   said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he
   said, I am.

   ^12And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order
   the child, and how shall we do unto him?

   ^13And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto
   the woman let her beware.

   ^14She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let
   her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I
   commanded her let her observe.

   ^15And Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord, I pray thee, let us
   detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.

   ^16And the angel of the Lord said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I
   will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering,
   thou must offer it unto the Lord. For Manoah knew not that he was an
   angel of the Lord.

   ^17And Manoah said unto the angel of the Lord, What is thy name, that
   when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?

   ^18And the angel of the Lord said unto him, Why askest thou thus after
   my name, seeing it is secret?

   ^19So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a
   rock unto the Lord: and the angel did wondrously; and Manoah and his
   wife looked on.

   ^20For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off
   the altar, that the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the
   altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to
   the ground.

   ^21But the angel of the Lord did no more appear to Manoah and to his
   wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the Lord.

   ^22And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have
   seen God.

   ^23But his wife said unto him, If the Lord were pleased to kill us, he
   would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our
   hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as
   at this time have told us such things as these.

   ^24And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child
   grew, and the Lord blessed him.

   ^25And the Spirit of the Lord began to move him at times in the camp of
   Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 14

   And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the
   daughters of the Philistines.

   ^2And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have
   seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now
   therefore get her for me to wife.

   ^3Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman
   among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou
   goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said
   unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.

   ^4But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord, that
   he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the
   Philistines had dominion over Israel.

   ^5Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and
   came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared
   against him.

   ^6And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and he rent him as
   he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told
   not his father or his mother what he had done.

   ^7And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson
   well.

   ^8And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see
   the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and
   honey in the carcase of the lion.

   ^9And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his
   father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not
   them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.

   ^10So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a
   feast; for so used the young men to do.

   ^11And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty
   companions to be with him.

   ^12And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you:
   if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast,
   and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change
   of garments:

   ^13But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets
   and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy
   riddle, that we may hear it.

   ^14And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of
   the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days
   expound the riddle.

   ^15And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's
   wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest
   we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to
   take that we have? is it not so?

   ^16And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me,
   and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my
   people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have
   not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?

   ^17And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted:
   and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she
   lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her
   people.

   ^18And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the
   sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a
   lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye
   had not found out my riddle.

   ^19And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he went down to
   Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave
   change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger
   was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.

   ^20But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as
   his friend.

    Chapter 15

   But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest,
   that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to
   my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.

   ^2And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated
   her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister
   fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.

   ^3And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than
   the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.

   ^4And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands,
   and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two
   tails.

   ^5And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the
   standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and
   also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.

   ^6Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered,
   Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife,
   and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt
   her and her father with fire.

   ^7And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be
   avenged of you, and after that I will cease.

   ^8And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went
   down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.

   ^9Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread
   themselves in Lehi.

   ^10And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they
   answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done
   to us.

   ^11Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam,
   and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers
   over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto
   them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.

   ^12And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may
   deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto
   them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.

   ^13And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and
   deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And
   they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.

   ^14And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and
   the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and the cords that were
   upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands
   loosed from off his hands.

   ^15And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and
   took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.

   ^16And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with
   the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.

   ^17And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he
   cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place
   Ramathlehi.

   ^18And he was sore athirst, and called on the Lord, and said, Thou hast
   given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now
   shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?

   ^19But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came
   water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he
   revived: wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in
   Lehi unto this day.

   ^20And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.

    Chapter 16

   Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto
   her.

   ^2And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they
   compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the
   city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is
   day, we shall kill him.

   ^3And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the
   doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with
   them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up
   to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.

   ^4And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of
   Sorek, whose name was Delilah.

   ^5And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her,
   Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means
   we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we
   will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.

   ^6And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great
   strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.

   ^7And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that
   were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.

   ^8Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs
   which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.

   ^9Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.
   And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he
   brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the
   fire. So his strength was not known.

   ^10And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told
   me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.

   ^11And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never
   were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.

   ^12Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said
   unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in
   wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a
   thread.

   ^13And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told
   me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto
   her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.

   ^14And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines
   be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away
   with the pin of the beam, and with the web.

   ^15And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine
   heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast
   not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.

   ^16And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and
   urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;

   ^17That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not
   come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from
   my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and
   I shall become weak, and be like any other man.

   ^18And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent
   and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once,
   for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines
   came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.

   ^19And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and
   she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began
   to afflict him, and his strength went from him.

   ^20And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out
   of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and
   shake myself. And he wist not that the Lord was departed from him.

   ^21But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him
   down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in
   the prison house.

   ^22Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was
   shaven.

   ^23Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to
   offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they
   said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.

   ^24And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said,
   Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of
   our country, which slew many of us.

   ^25And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said,
   Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson
   out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him
   between the pillars.

   ^26And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me
   that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may
   lean upon them.

   ^27Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the
   Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three
   thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.

   ^28And Samson called unto the Lord, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me,
   I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God,
   that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.

   ^29And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house
   stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand,
   and of the other with his left.

   ^30And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed
   himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon
   all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his
   death were more than they which he slew in his life.

   ^31Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and
   took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol
   in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty
   years.

    Chapter 17

   And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.

   ^2And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver
   that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of
   also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his
   mother said, Blessed be thou of the Lord, my son.

   ^3And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his
   mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the
   Lord from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten
   image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.

   ^4Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two
   hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made
   thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house
   of Micah.

   ^5And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and
   teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.

   ^6In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that
   which was right in his own eyes.

   ^7And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of
   Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.

   ^8And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn
   where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house
   of Micah, as he journeyed.

   ^9And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I
   am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a
   place.

   ^10And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and
   a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a
   suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.

   ^11And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man
   was unto him as one of his sons.

   ^12And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his
   priest, and was in the house of Micah.

   ^13Then said Micah, Now know I that the Lord will do me good, seeing I
   have a Levite to my priest.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 18

   In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe
   of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that
   day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of
   Israel.

   ^2And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their
   coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the
   land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land:
   who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged
   there.

   ^3When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the
   young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him,
   Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what
   hast thou here?

   ^4And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath
   hired me, and I am his priest.

   ^5And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we
   may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.

   ^6And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the Lord is your
   way wherein ye go.

   ^7Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people
   that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the
   Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land,
   that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the
   Zidonians, and had no business with any man.

   ^8And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their
   brethren said unto them, What say ye?

   ^9And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have
   seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not
   slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.

   ^10When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land:
   for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want
   of any thing that is in the earth.

   ^11And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of
   Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of
   war.

   ^12And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore
   they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is behind
   Kirjathjearim.

   ^13And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house
   of Micah.

   ^14Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of
   Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these
   houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image?
   now therefore consider what ye have to do.

   ^15And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man
   the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.

   ^16And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which
   were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.

   ^17And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in
   thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim,
   and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate
   with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.

   ^18And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the
   ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest
   unto them, What do ye?

   ^19And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy
   mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better
   for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a
   priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?

   ^20And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the
   teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.

   ^21So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle
   and the carriage before them.

   ^22And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that
   were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and
   overtook the children of Dan.

   ^23And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their
   faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with
   such a company?

   ^24And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the
   priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this
   that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?

   ^25And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard
   among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life,
   with the lives of thy household.

   ^26And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they
   were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.

   ^27And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which
   he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and
   secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the
   city with fire.

   ^28And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they
   had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by
   Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.

   ^29And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan
   their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city
   was Laish at the first.

   ^30And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the
   son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to
   the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.

   ^31And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the
   time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 19

   And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel,
   that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount
   Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.

   ^2And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from
   him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole
   months.

   ^3And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto
   her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple
   of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the
   father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.

   ^4And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he
   abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.

   ^5And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the
   morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto
   his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and
   afterward go your way.

   ^6And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for
   the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and
   tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.

   ^7And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him:
   therefore he lodged there again.

   ^8And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the
   damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they
   tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.

   ^9And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his
   servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold,
   now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold,
   the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry;
   and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.

   ^10But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed,
   and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with
   him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.

   ^11And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant
   said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this
   city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.

   ^12And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the
   city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass
   over to Gibeah.

   ^13And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of
   these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.

   ^14And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon
   them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.

   ^15And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and
   when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was
   no man that took them into his house to lodging.

   ^16And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at
   even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but
   the men of the place were Benjamites.

   ^17And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the
   street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and
   whence comest thou?

   ^18And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the
   side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah,
   but I am now going to the house of the Lord; and there is no man that
   receiveth me to house.

   ^19Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is
   bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man
   which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.

   ^20And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy
   wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.

   ^21So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses:
   and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.

   ^22Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the
   city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at
   the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying,
   Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him.

   ^23And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said
   unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly;
   seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.

   ^24Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will
   bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good
   unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.

   ^25But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine,
   and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all
   the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let
   her go.

   ^26Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the
   door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.

   ^27And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the
   house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine
   was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the
   threshold.

   ^28And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered.
   Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him
   unto his place.

   ^29And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold
   on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve
   pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.

   ^30And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed
   done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of
   the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak
   your minds.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 20

   Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was
   gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land
   of Gilead, unto the Lord in Mizpeh.

   ^2And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel,
   presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred
   thousand footmen that drew sword.

   ^3(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were
   gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was
   this wickedness?

   ^4And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and
   said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my
   concubine, to lodge.

   ^5And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round
   about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine
   have they forced, that she is dead.

   ^6And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her
   throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have
   committed lewdness and folly in Israel.

   ^7Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and
   counsel.

   ^8And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go
   to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.

   ^9But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will
   go up by lot against it;

   ^10And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of
   Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten
   thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they
   come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have
   wrought in Israel.

   ^11So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit
   together as one man.

   ^12And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin,
   saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?

   ^13Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are
   in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from
   Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of
   their brethren the children of Israel:

   ^14But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the
   cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.

   ^15And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the
   cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the
   inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.

   ^16Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men
   lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not
   miss.

   ^17And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred
   thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.

   ^18And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God,
   and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to
   the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the Lord said, Judah
   shall go up first.

   ^19And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped
   against Gibeah.

   ^20And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the
   men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah.

   ^21And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed
   down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand
   men.

   ^22And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set
   their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in
   array the first day.

   ^23(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the Lord until
   even, and asked counsel of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up again to
   battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the Lord said,
   Go up against him.)

   ^24And the children of Israel came near against the children of
   Benjamin the second day.

   ^25And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day,
   and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again
   eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.

   ^26Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and
   came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the Lord,
   and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace
   offerings before the Lord.

   ^27And the children of Israel enquired of the Lord, (for the ark of the
   covenant of God was there in those days,

   ^28And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it
   in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the
   children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the Lord said,
   Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.

   ^29And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.

   ^30And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin
   on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at
   other times.

   ^31And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were
   drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and
   kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the
   house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of
   Israel.

   ^32And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us,
   as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw
   them from the city unto the highways.

   ^33And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put
   themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came
   forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.

   ^34And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all
   Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near
   them.

   ^35And the Lord smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of
   Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand
   and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.

   ^36So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men
   of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the
   liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.

   ^37And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers
   in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of
   the sword.

   ^38Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the
   liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up
   out of the city.

   ^39And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to
   smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they
   said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.

   ^40But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar
   of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of
   the city ascended up to heaven.

   ^41And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were
   amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.

   ^42Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the
   way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which
   came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.

   ^43Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and
   trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.

   ^44And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men
   of valour.

   ^45And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of
   Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and
   pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.

   ^46So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five
   thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.

   ^47But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock
   Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.

   ^48And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin,
   and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every
   city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire
   all the cities that they came to.

    Chapter 21

   Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any
   of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.

   ^2And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even
   before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;

   ^3And said, O Lord God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel,
   that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?

   ^4And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and
   built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.

   ^5And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of
   Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the Lord? For they
   had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the Lord to
   Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.

   ^6And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother,
   and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.

   ^7How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn
   by the Lord that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?

   ^8And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came
   not up to Mizpeh to the Lord? And, behold, there came none to the camp
   from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.

   ^9For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the
   inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.

   ^10And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the
   valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of
   Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the
   children.

   ^11And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy
   every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.

   ^12And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred
   young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they
   brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.

   ^13And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of
   Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them.

   ^14And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which
   they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh- gilead: and yet so they
   sufficed them not.

   ^15And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the Lord had
   made a breach in the tribes of Israel.

   ^16Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives
   for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?

   ^17And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped
   of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel.

   ^18Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the
   children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife
   to Benjamin.

   ^19Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the Lord in Shiloh
   yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east
   side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the
   south of Lebonah.

   ^20Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and
   lie in wait in the vineyards;

   ^21And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance
   in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man
   his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.

   ^22And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us
   to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for
   our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for
   ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.

   ^23And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according
   to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went
   and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt
   in them.

   ^24And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man
   to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man
   to his inheritance.

   ^25In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which
   was right in his own eyes.

    Chapter 1

   Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a
   famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn
   in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.

   ^2And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife
   Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of
   Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued
   there.

   ^3And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two
   sons.

   ^4And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one
   was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about
   ten years.

   ^5And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left
   of her two sons and her husband.

   ^6Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from
   the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that
   the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread.

   ^7Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two
   daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the
   land of Judah.

   ^8And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her
   mother's house: the Lord deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with
   the dead, and with me.

   ^9The Lord grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of
   her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and
   wept.

   ^10And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy
   people.

   ^11And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me?
   are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?

   ^12Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an
   husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also
   to night, and should also bear sons;

   ^13Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them
   from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for
   your sakes that the hand of the Lord is gone out against me.

   ^14And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her
   mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.

   ^15And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her
   people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.

   ^16And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from
   following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou
   lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my
   God:

   ^17Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord
   do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.

   ^18When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she
   left speaking unto her.

   ^19So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass,
   when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about
   them, and they said, Is this Naomi?

   ^20And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the
   Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.

   ^21I went out full, and the Lord hath brought me home again empty: why
   then call ye me Naomi, seeing the Lord hath testified against me, and
   the Almighty hath afflicted me?

   ^22So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with
   her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to
   Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 2

   And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of
   the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.

   ^2And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field,
   and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And
   she said unto her, Go, my daughter.

   ^3And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers:
   and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz,
   who was of the kindred of Elimelech.

   ^4And, behold Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The
   Lord be with you. And they answered him, The Lord bless thee.

   ^5Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose
   damsel is this?

   ^6And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It
   is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of
   Moab:

   ^7And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers
   among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the
   morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.

   ^8Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to
   glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by
   my maidens:

   ^9Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after
   them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee?
   and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which
   the young men have drawn.

   ^10Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said
   unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest
   take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?

   ^11And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me,
   all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine
   husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land
   of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not
   heretofore.

   ^12The Lord recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the
   Lord God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.

   ^13Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that
   thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto
   thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.

   ^14And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the
   bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the
   reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was
   sufficed, and left.

   ^15And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men,
   saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:

   ^16And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave
   them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.

   ^17So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had
   gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.

   ^18And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law
   saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that
   she had reserved after she was sufficed.

   ^19And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day?
   and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of
   thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and
   said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.

   ^20And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the Lord,
   who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And
   Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next
   kinsmen.

   ^21And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep
   fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.

   ^22And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my
   daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in
   any other field.

   ^23So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of
   barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 3

   Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not
   seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?

   ^2And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast?
   Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.

   ^3Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon
   thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto
   the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.

   ^4And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place
   where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay
   thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.

   ^5And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.

   ^6And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her
   mother in law bade her.

   ^7And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went
   to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and
   uncovered his feet, and laid her down.

   ^8And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned
   himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.

   ^9And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine
   handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art
   a near kinsman.

   ^10And he said, Blessed be thou of the Lord, my daughter: for thou hast
   shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch
   as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.

   ^11And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou
   requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a
   virtuous woman.

   ^12And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a
   kinsman nearer than I.

   ^13Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will
   perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's
   part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I
   do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the Lord liveth: lie down until
   the morning.

   ^14And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before
   one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman
   came into the floor.

   ^15Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it.
   And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it
   on her: and she went into the city.

   ^16And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my
   daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.

   ^17And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said
   to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.

   ^18Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the
   matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have
   finished the thing this day.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 4

   Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the
   kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one!
   turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.

   ^2And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down
   here. And they sat down.

   ^3And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the
   country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother
   Elimelech's:

   ^4And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the
   inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem
   it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may
   know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee.
   And he said, I will redeem it.

   ^5Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi,
   thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to
   raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.

   ^6And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine
   own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem
   it.

   ^7Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming
   and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off
   his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in
   Israel.

   ^8Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off
   his shoe.

   ^9And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are
   witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and
   all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.

   ^10Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to
   be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that
   the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from
   the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.

   ^11And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We
   are witnesses. The Lord make the woman that is come into thine house
   like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and
   do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:

   ^12And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto
   Judah, of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this young woman.

   ^13So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto
   her, the Lord gave her conception, and she bare a son.

   ^14And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the Lord, which hath not
   left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in
   Israel.

   ^15And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of
   thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is
   better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.

   ^16And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse
   unto it.

   ^17And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son
   born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of
   Jesse, the father of David.

   ^18Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,

   ^19And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,

   ^20And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,

   ^21And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,

   ^22And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.

    Chapter Samuel 1

   Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and
   his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of
   Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:

   ^2And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of
   the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no
   children.

   ^3And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
   sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli,
   Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord, were there.

   ^4And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his
   wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:

   ^5But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but
   the Lord had shut up her womb.

   ^6And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret,
   because the Lord had shut up her womb.

   ^7And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the
   Lord, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.

   ^8Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and
   why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to
   thee than ten sons?

   ^9So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had
   drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of
   the Lord.

   ^10And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the Lord, and
   wept sore.

   ^11And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed
   look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not
   forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child,
   then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life, and there
   shall no razor come upon his head.

   ^12And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the Lord, that
   Eli marked her mouth.

   ^13Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her
   voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.

   ^14And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy
   wine from thee.

   ^15And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a
   sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have
   poured out my soul before the Lord.

   ^16Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the
   abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.

   ^17Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant
   thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.

   ^18And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the
   woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.

   ^19And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the
   Lord, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew
   Hannah his wife; and the Lord remembered her.

   ^20Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah
   had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying,
   Because I have asked him of the Lord.

   ^21And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the
   Lord the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.

   ^22But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go
   up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may
   appear before the Lord, and there abide for ever.

   ^23And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good;
   tarry until thou have weaned him; only the Lord establish his word. So
   the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.

   ^24And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three
   bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him
   unto the house of the Lord in Shiloh: and the child was young.

   ^25And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.

   ^26And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the
   woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord.

   ^27For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition
   which I asked of him:

   ^28Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he
   shall be lent to the Lord. And he worshipped the Lord there.

    Chapter Samuel 2

   And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the Lord, mine horn
   is exalted in the Lord: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because
   I rejoice in thy salvation.

   ^2There is none holy as the Lord: for there is none beside thee:
   neither is there any rock like our God.

   ^3Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your
   mouth: for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are
   weighed.

   ^4The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are
   girded with strength.

   ^5They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they
   that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she
   that hath many children is waxed feeble.

   ^6The Lord killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave,
   and bringeth up.

   ^7The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth
   up.

   ^8He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar
   from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit
   the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the Lord'S, and
   he hath set the world upon them.

   ^9He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent
   in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.

   ^10The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven
   shall he thunder upon them: the Lord shall judge the ends of the earth;
   and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his
   anointed.

   ^11And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister
   unto the Lord before Eli the priest.

   ^12Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the Lord.

   ^13And the priests' custom with the people was, that, when any man
   offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in
   seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;

   ^14And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all
   that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did
   in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.

   ^15Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said
   to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he
   will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.

   ^16And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat
   presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would
   answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take
   it by force.

   ^17Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord:
   for men abhorred the offering of the Lord.

   ^18But Samuel ministered before the Lord, being a child, girded with a
   linen ephod.

   ^19Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him
   from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the
   yearly sacrifice.

   ^20And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The Lord give thee
   seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the Lord. And they
   went unto their own home.

   ^21And the Lord visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three
   sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the Lord.

   ^22Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all
   Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of
   the tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^23And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your
   evil dealings by all this people.

   ^24Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the
   Lord'S people to transgress.

   ^25If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a
   man sin against the Lord, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding
   they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the Lord
   would slay them.

   ^26And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord,
   and also with men.

   ^27And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith
   the Lord, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they
   were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?

   ^28And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my
   priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod
   before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the
   offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?

   ^29Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have
   commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make
   yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my
   people?

   ^30Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy
   house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but
   now the Lord saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will
   honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.

   ^31Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of
   thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.

   ^32And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth
   which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine
   house for ever.

   ^33And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar,
   shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the
   increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.

   ^34And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two
   sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.

   ^35And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to
   that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure
   house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.

   ^36And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine
   house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel
   of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests'
   offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.

    Chapter Samuel 3

   And the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli. And the word
   of the Lord was precious in those days; there was no open vision.

   ^2And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his
   place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;

   ^3And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord, where the
   ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;

   ^4That the Lord called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.

   ^5And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And
   he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.

   ^6And the Lord called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to
   Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I
   called not, my son; lie down again.

   ^7Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither was the word of the
   Lord yet revealed unto him.

   ^8And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and
   went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli
   perceived that the Lord had called the child.

   ^9Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he
   call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth.
   So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

   ^10And the Lord came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel,
   Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.

   ^11And the Lord said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at
   which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.

   ^12In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have
   spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.

   ^13For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the
   iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and
   he restrained them not.

   ^14And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity
   of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for
   ever.

   ^15And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house
   of the Lord. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.

   ^16Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered,
   Here am I.

   ^17And he said, What is the thing that the Lord hath said unto thee? I
   pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if
   thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.

   ^18And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he
   said, It is the Lord: let him do what seemeth him good.

   ^19And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and did let none of his
   words fall to the ground.

   ^20And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
   established to be a prophet of the Lord.

   ^21And the Lord appeared again in Shiloh: for the Lord revealed himself
   to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 4

   And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against
   the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the
   Philistines pitched in Aphek.

   ^2And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when
   they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they
   slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.

   ^3And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel
   said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us to day before the Philistines?
   Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us,
   that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our
   enemies.

   ^4So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the
   ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth between the
   cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there
   with the ark of the covenant of God.

   ^5And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all
   Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.

   ^6And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said,
   What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?
   And they understood that the ark of the Lord was come into the camp.

   ^7And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the
   camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing
   heretofore.

   ^8Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty
   Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues
   in the wilderness.

   ^9Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be
   not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit
   yourselves like men, and fight.

   ^10And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled
   every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for
   there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.

   ^11And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and
   Phinehas, were slain.

   ^12And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh
   the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.

   ^13And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching:
   for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into
   the city, and told it, all the city cried out.

   ^14And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth
   the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.

   ^15Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that
   he could not see.

   ^16And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I
   fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son?

   ^17And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the
   Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the
   people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the
   ark of God is taken.

   ^18And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he
   fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck
   brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged
   Israel forty years.

   ^19And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be
   delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was
   taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed
   herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.

   ^20And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said
   unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not,
   neither did she regard it.

   ^21And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from
   Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in
   law and her husband.

   ^22And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God
   is taken.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 5

   And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer
   unto Ashdod.

   ^2When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the
   house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.

   ^3And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was
   fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the Lord. And they
   took Dagon, and set him in his place again.

   ^4And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was
   fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord; and the
   head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the
   threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.

   ^5Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into
   Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.

   ^6But the hand of the Lord was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he
   destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts
   thereof.

   ^7And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of
   the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon
   us, and upon Dagon our god.

   ^8They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines
   unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of
   Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried
   about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about
   thither.

   ^9And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the
   Lord was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote
   the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in
   their secret parts.

   ^10Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as
   the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying,
   They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us
   and our people.

   ^11So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines,
   and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again
   to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a
   deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very
   heavy there.

   ^12And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry
   of the city went up to heaven.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 6

   And the ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines seven
   months.

   ^2And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying,
   What shall we do to the ark of the Lord? tell us wherewith we shall
   send it to his place.

   ^3And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it
   not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye
   shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not
   removed from you.

   ^4Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall
   return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden
   mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one
   plague was on you all, and on your lords.

   ^5Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your
   mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel:
   peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your
   gods, and from off your land.

   ^6Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh
   hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did
   they not let the people go, and they departed?

   ^7Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which
   there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their
   calves home from them:

   ^8And take the ark of the Lord, and lay it upon the cart; and put the
   jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass offering, in a
   coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.

   ^9And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh,
   then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know
   that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to
   us.

   ^10And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the
   cart, and shut up their calves at home:

   ^11And they laid the ark of the Lord upon the cart, and the coffer with
   the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.

   ^12And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and
   went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to
   the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went
   after them unto the border of Bethshemesh.

   ^13And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the
   valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to
   see it.

   ^14And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood
   there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of the
   cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the Lord.

   ^15And the Levites took down the ark of the Lord, and the coffer that
   was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great
   stone: and the men of Beth- shemesh offered burnt offerings and
   sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the Lord.

   ^16And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they
   returned to Ekron the same day.

   ^17And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for
   a trespass offering unto the Lord; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for
   Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;

   ^18And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of
   the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and
   of country villages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they
   set down the ark of the Lord: which stone remaineth unto this day in
   the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite.

   ^19And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into
   the ark of the Lord, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and
   threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the Lord had
   smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.

   ^20And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this
   holy Lord God? and to whom shall he go up from us?

   ^21And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim,
   saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the Lord; come ye
   down, and fetch it up to you.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 7

   And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the Lord,
   and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified
   Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the Lord.

   ^2And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the
   time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel
   lamented after the Lord.

   ^3And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do
   return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the strange
   gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the
   Lord, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of
   the Philistines.

   ^4Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and
   served the Lord only.

   ^5And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you
   unto the Lord.

   ^6And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it
   out before the Lord, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have
   sinned against the Lord. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in
   Mizpeh.

   ^7And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were
   gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up
   against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were
   afraid of the Philistines.

   ^8And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the
   Lord our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the
   Philistines.

   ^9And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt offering
   wholly unto the Lord: and Samuel cried unto the Lord for Israel; and
   the Lord heard him.

   ^10And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines
   drew near to battle against Israel: but the Lord thundered with a great
   thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and
   they were smitten before Israel.

   ^11And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
   Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.

   ^12Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and
   called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped
   us.

   ^13So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the
   coast of Israel: and the hand of the Lord was against the Philistines
   all the days of Samuel.

   ^14And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were
   restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof
   did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was
   peace between Israel and the Amorites.

   ^15And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.

   ^16And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and
   Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.

   ^17And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he
   judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 8

   And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges
   over Israel.

   ^2Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second,
   Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.

   ^3And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre,
   and took bribes, and perverted judgment.

   ^4Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came
   to Samuel unto Ramah,

   ^5And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy
   ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.

   ^6But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to
   judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord.

   ^7And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people
   in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but
   they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.

   ^8According to all the works which they have done since the day that I
   brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have
   forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.

   ^9Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly
   unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over
   them.

   ^10And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked
   of him a king.

   ^11And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign
   over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his
   chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his
   chariots.

   ^12And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over
   fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest,
   and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots.

   ^13And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be
   cooks, and to be bakers.

   ^14And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
   oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.

   ^15And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and
   give to his officers, and to his servants.

   ^16And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your
   goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.

   ^17He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants.

   ^18And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall
   have chosen you; and the Lord will not hear you in that day.

   ^19Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and
   they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;

   ^20That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may
   judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.

   ^21And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them
   in the ears of the Lord.

   ^22And the Lord said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them
   a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto
   his city.

    Chapter Samuel 9

   Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel,
   the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite,
   a mighty man of power.

   ^2And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a
   goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier
   person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of
   the people.

   ^3And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul
   his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the
   asses.

   ^4And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of
   Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of
   Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the
   Benjamites, but they found them not.

   ^5And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant
   that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring
   for the asses, and take thought for us.

   ^6And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God,
   and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass:
   now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we
   should go.

   ^7Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we
   bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not
   a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?

   ^8And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at
   hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man
   of God, to tell us our way.

   ^9(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he
   spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a
   Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)

   ^10Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they
   went unto the city where the man of God was.

   ^11And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens
   going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?

   ^12And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you:
   make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a
   sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:

   ^13As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him,
   before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat
   until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they
   eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye
   shall find him.

   ^14And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the
   city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high
   place.

   ^15Now the Lord had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came,
   saying,

   ^16To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of
   Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people
   Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines:
   for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.

   ^17And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said unto him, Behold the man
   whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.

   ^18Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray
   thee, where the seer's house is.

   ^19And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me
   unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I
   will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.

   ^20And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy
   mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of
   Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?

   ^21And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of
   the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of
   the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?

   ^22And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the
   parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were
   bidden, which were about thirty persons.

   ^23And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee,
   of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.

   ^24And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and
   set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it
   before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee
   since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel
   that day.

   ^25And when they were come down from the high place into the city,
   Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.

   ^26And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the
   day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that
   I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them,
   he and Samuel, abroad.

   ^27And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to
   Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand
   thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.

    Chapter Samuel 10

   Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed
   him, and said, Is it not because the Lord hath anointed thee to be
   captain over his inheritance?

   ^2When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men
   by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they
   will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found:
   and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for
   you, saying, What shall I do for my son?

   ^3Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the
   plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to
   Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of
   bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:

   ^4And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which
   thou shalt receive of their hands.

   ^5After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison
   of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come
   thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming
   down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and
   a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:

   ^6And the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, and thou shalt
   prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.

   ^7And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as
   occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.

   ^8And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come
   down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices
   of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee,
   and shew thee what thou shalt do.

   ^9And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel,
   God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.

   ^10And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of
   prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he
   prophesied among them.

   ^11And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that,
   behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to
   another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also
   among the prophets?

   ^12And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their
   father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?

   ^13And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high
   place.

   ^14And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye?
   And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no
   where, we came to Samuel.

   ^15And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto
   you.

   ^16And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were
   found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told
   him not.

   ^17And Samuel called the people together unto the Lord to Mizpeh;

   ^18And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God of
   Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the
   hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them
   that oppressed you:

   ^19And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of
   all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him,
   Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before
   the Lord by your tribes, and by your thousands.

   ^20And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near,
   the tribe of Benjamin was taken.

   ^21When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their
   families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was
   taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.

   ^22Therefore they enquired of the Lord further, if the man should yet
   come thither. And the Lord answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among
   the stuff.

   ^23And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the
   people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and
   upward.

   ^24And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the Lord hath
   chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the
   people shouted, and said, God save the king.

   ^25Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it
   in a book, and laid it up before the Lord. And Samuel sent all the
   people away, every man to his house.

   ^26And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of
   men, whose hearts God had touched.

   ^27But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And
   they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 11

   Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead:
   and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us,
   and we will serve thee.

   ^2And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will I make
   a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay
   it for a reproach upon all Israel.

   ^3And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite,
   that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if
   there be no man to save us, we will come out to thee.

   ^4Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in
   the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and
   wept.

   ^5And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul
   said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they told him the
   tidings of the men of Jabesh.

   ^6And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and
   his anger was kindled greatly.

   ^7And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them
   throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying,
   Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be
   done unto his oxen. And the fear of the Lord fell on the people, and
   they came out with one consent.

   ^8And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three
   hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.

   ^9And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto
   the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye
   shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of
   Jabesh; and they were glad.

   ^10Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto
   you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you.

   ^11And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three
   companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning
   watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to
   pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were
   not left together.

   ^12And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall Saul
   reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.

   ^13And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for
   to day the Lord hath wrought salvation in Israel.

   ^14Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and
   renew the kingdom there.

   ^15And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king
   before the Lord in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of
   peace offerings before the Lord; and there Saul and all the men of
   Israel rejoiced greatly.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 12

   And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your
   voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.

   ^2And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and
   grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before
   you from my childhood unto this day.

   ^3Behold, here I am: witness against me before the Lord, and before his
   anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom
   have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I
   received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it
   you.

   ^4And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither
   hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.

   ^5And he said unto them, The Lord is witness against you, and his
   anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand.
   And they answered, He is witness.

   ^6And Samuel said unto the people, It is the Lord that advanced Moses
   and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.

   ^7Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the Lord
   of all the righteous acts of the Lord, which he did to you and to your
   fathers.

   ^8When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the Lord,
   then the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers
   out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.

   ^9And when they forgat the Lord their God, he sold them into the hand
   of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the
   Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought
   against them.

   ^10And they cried unto the Lord, and said, We have sinned, because we
   have forsaken the Lord, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now
   deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.

   ^11And the Lord sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel,
   and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye
   dwelled safe.

   ^12And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came
   against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when
   the Lord your God was your king.

   ^13Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have
   desired! and, behold, the Lord hath set a king over you.

   ^14If ye will fear the Lord, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not
   rebel against the commandment of the Lord, then shall both ye and also
   the king that reigneth over you continue following the Lord your God:

   ^15But if ye will not obey the voice of the Lord, but rebel against the
   commandment of the Lord, then shall the hand of the Lord be against
   you, as it was against your fathers.

   ^16Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the Lord will do
   before your eyes.

   ^17Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the Lord, and he
   shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your
   wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the Lord, in
   asking you a king.

   ^18So Samuel called unto the Lord; and the Lord sent thunder and rain
   that day: and all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel.

   ^19And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the
   Lord thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this
   evil, to ask us a king.

   ^20And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this
   wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the Lord, but serve the
   Lord with all your heart;

   ^21And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things,
   which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.

   ^22For the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name's sake:
   because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people.

   ^23Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in
   ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right
   way:

   ^24Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for
   consider how great things he hath done for you.

   ^25But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and
   your king.

    Chapter Samuel 13

   Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,

   ^2Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand
   were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were
   with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent
   every man to his tent.

   ^3And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba,
   and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout
   all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.

   ^4And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the
   Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the
   Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.

   ^5And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with
   Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people
   as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up,
   and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth- aven.

   ^6When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the
   people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves,
   and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.

   ^7And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and
   Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed
   him trembling.

   ^8And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had
   appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered
   from him.

   ^9And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace
   offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.

   ^10And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering
   the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him,
   that he might salute him.

   ^11And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw
   that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within
   the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves
   together at Michmash;

   ^12Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to
   Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the Lord: I forced myself
   therefore, and offered a burnt offering.

   ^13And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not
   kept the commandment of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee: for
   now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.

   ^14But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the Lord hath sought him a
   man after his own heart, and the Lord hath commanded him to be captain
   over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the Lord
   commanded thee.

   ^15And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of
   Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him,
   about six hundred men.

   ^16And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present
   with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in
   Michmash.

   ^17And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three
   companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto
   the land of Shual:

   ^18And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company
   turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim
   toward the wilderness.

   ^19Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for
   the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:

   ^20But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen
   every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.

   ^21Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for
   the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.

   ^22So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither
   sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with
   Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there
   found.

   ^23And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of
   Michmash.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 14

   Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto
   the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the
   Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his
   father.

   ^2And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate
   tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about
   six hundred men;

   ^3And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas,
   the son of Eli, the Lord'S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the
   people knew not that Jonathan was gone.

   ^4And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto
   the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and
   a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and
   the name of the other Seneh.

   ^5The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash,
   and the other southward over against Gibeah.

   ^6And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and
   let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that
   the Lord will work for us: for there is no restraint to the Lord to
   save by many or by few.

   ^7And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart:
   turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.

   ^8Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we
   will discover ourselves unto them.

   ^9If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will
   stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.

   ^10But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the
   Lord hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto
   us.

   ^11And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the
   Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth
   out of the holes where they had hid themselves.

   ^12And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer,
   and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan
   said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the Lord hath
   delivered them into the hand of Israel.

   ^13And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his
   armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his
   armourbearer slew after him.

   ^14And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made,
   was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a
   yoke of oxen might plow.

   ^15And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the
   people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the
   earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.

   ^16And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold,
   the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.

   ^17Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and
   see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan
   and his armourbearer were not there.

   ^18And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark
   of God was at that time with the children of Israel.

   ^19And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the
   noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased:
   and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.

   ^20And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves,
   and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against
   his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.

   ^21Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that
   time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round
   about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with
   Saul and Jonathan.

   ^22Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount
   Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also
   followed hard after them in the battle.

   ^23So the Lord saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto
   Bethaven.

   ^24And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured
   the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until
   evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people
   tasted any food.

   ^25And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon
   the ground.

   ^26And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey
   dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared
   the oath.

   ^27But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the
   oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand,
   and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his
   eyes were enlightened.

   ^28Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly
   charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth
   any food this day. And the people were faint.

   ^29Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray
   you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of
   this honey.

   ^30How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the
   spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a
   much greater slaughter among the Philistines?

   ^31And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon:
   and the people were very faint.

   ^32And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and
   calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with
   the blood.

   ^33Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the
   Lord, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have
   transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.

   ^34And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto
   them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and
   slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the Lord in eating with
   the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that
   night, and slew them there.

   ^35And Saul built an altar unto the Lord: the same was the first altar
   that he built unto the Lord.

   ^36And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and
   spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.
   And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the
   priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.

   ^37And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the
   Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he
   answered him not that day.

   ^38And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and
   know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.

   ^39For, as the Lord liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in
   Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all
   the people that answered him.

   ^40Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan
   my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do
   what seemeth good unto thee.

   ^41Therefore Saul said unto the Lord God of Israel, Give a perfect lot.
   And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.

   ^42And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And
   Jonathan was taken.

   ^43Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And
   Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the
   end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.

   ^44And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely
   die, Jonathan.

   ^45And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought
   this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the Lord liveth, there
   shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought
   with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.

   ^46Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the
   Philistines went to their own place.

   ^47So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his
   enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon,
   and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the
   Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.

   ^48And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered
   Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.

   ^49Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and
   the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn
   Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:

   ^50And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz:
   and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner,
   Saul's uncle.

   ^51And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the
   son of Abiel.

   ^52And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul:
   and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto
   him.

    Chapter Samuel 15

   Samuel also said unto Saul, The Lord sent me to anoint thee to be king
   over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice
   of the words of the Lord.

   ^2Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to
   Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from
   Egypt.

   ^3Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and
   spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox
   and sheep, camel and ass.

   ^4And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim,
   two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.

   ^5And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.

   ^6And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among
   the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to
   all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the
   Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.

   ^7And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur,
   that is over against Egypt.

   ^8And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
   destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.

   ^9But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and
   of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good,
   and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and
   refuse, that they destroyed utterly.

   ^10Then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel, saying,

   ^11It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned
   back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it
   grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the Lord all night.

   ^12And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told
   Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a
   place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.

   ^13And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of
   the Lord: I have performed the commandment of the Lord.

   ^14And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in
   mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?

   ^15And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the
   people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto
   the Lord thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.

   ^16Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the Lord
   hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.

   ^17And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou
   not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord anointed thee
   king over Israel?

   ^18And the Lord sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly
   destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they
   be consumed.

   ^19Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the Lord, but didst
   fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the Lord?

   ^20And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the Lord,
   and have gone the way which the Lord sent me, and have brought Agag the
   king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.

   ^21But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the
   things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the
   Lord thy God in Gilgal.

   ^22And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings
   and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is
   better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.

   ^23For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as
   iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord,
   he hath also rejected thee from being king.

   ^24And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed
   the commandment of the Lord, and thy words: because I feared the
   people, and obeyed their voice.

   ^25Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me,
   that I may worship the Lord.

   ^26And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou
   hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath rejected thee
   from being king over Israel.

   ^27And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt
   of his mantle, and it rent.

   ^28And Samuel said unto him, The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel
   from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is
   better than thou.

   ^29And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is
   not a man, that he should repent.

   ^30Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before
   the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me,
   that I may worship the Lord thy God.

   ^31So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the Lord.

   ^32Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
   Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely
   the bitterness of death is past.

   ^33And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall
   thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces
   before the Lord in Gilgal.

   ^34Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah
   of Saul.

   ^35And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death:
   nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the Lord repented that he had
   made Saul king over Israel.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 16

   And the Lord said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,
   seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn
   with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I
   have provided me a king among his sons.

   ^2And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And
   the Lord said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to
   sacrifice to the Lord.

   ^3And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt
   do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.

   ^4And Samuel did that which the Lord spake, and came to Bethlehem. And
   the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou
   peaceably?

   ^5And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord:
   sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he
   sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.

   ^6And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab,
   and said, Surely the Lord'S anointed is before him.

   ^7But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the
   height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth
   not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the
   Lord looketh on the heart.

   ^8Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he
   said, Neither hath the Lord chosen this.

   ^9Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the
   Lord chosen this.

   ^10Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And
   Samuel said unto Jesse, The Lord hath not chosen these.

   ^11And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said,
   There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep.
   And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit
   down till he come hither.

   ^12And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a
   beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, Arise,
   anoint him: for this is he.

   ^13Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of
   his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day
   forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.

   ^14But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit
   from the Lord troubled him.

   ^15And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from
   God troubleth thee.

   ^16Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to
   seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come
   to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play
   with his hand, and thou shalt be well.

   ^17And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play
   well, and bring him to me.

   ^18Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a
   son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty
   valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely
   person, and the Lord is with him.

   ^19Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David
   thy son, which is with the sheep.

   ^20And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a
   kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.

   ^21And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him
   greatly; and he became his armourbearer.

   ^22And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before
   me; for he hath found favour in my sight.

   ^23And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul,
   that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was
   refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.

    Chapter Samuel 17

   Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were
   gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched
   between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.

   ^2And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by
   the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the
   Philistines.

   ^3And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel
   stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between
   them.

   ^4And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,
   named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.

   ^5And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a
   coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of
   brass.

   ^6And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass
   between his shoulders.

   ^7And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's
   head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went
   before him.

   ^8And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them,
   Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine,
   and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come
   down to me.

   ^9If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your
   servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be
   our servants, and serve us.

   ^10And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give
   me a man, that we may fight together.

   ^11When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they
   were dismayed, and greatly afraid.

   ^12Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose
   name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for
   an old man in the days of Saul.

   ^13And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the
   battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were
   Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.

   ^14And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.

   ^15But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at
   Bethlehem.

   ^16And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented
   himself forty days.

   ^17And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an
   ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp
   to thy brethren;

   ^18And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and
   look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.

   ^19Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of
   Elah, fighting with the Philistines.

   ^20And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a
   keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to
   the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for
   the battle.

   ^21For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army
   against army.

   ^22And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
   carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.

   ^23And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the
   Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the
   Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard
   them.

   ^24And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and
   were sore afraid.

   ^25And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up?
   surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who
   killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give
   him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.

   ^26And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be
   done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the
   reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he
   should defy the armies of the living God?

   ^27And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it
   be done to the man that killeth him.

   ^28And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and
   Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou
   down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the
   wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for
   thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.

   ^29And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?

   ^30And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same
   manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.

   ^31And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them
   before Saul: and he sent for him.

   ^32And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy
   servant will go and fight with this Philistine.

   ^33And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
   Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of
   war from his youth.

   ^34And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and
   there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:

   ^35And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his
   mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and
   smote him, and slew him.

   ^36Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised
   Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of
   the living God.

   ^37David said moreover, The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of
   the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the
   hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the Lord be
   with thee.

   ^38And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass
   upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.

   ^39And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go;
   for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with
   these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.

   ^40And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones
   out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even
   in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the
   Philistine.

   ^41And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man
   that bare the shield went before him.

   ^42And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained
   him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.

   ^43And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to
   me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.

   ^44And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy
   flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.

   ^45Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword,
   and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of
   the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast
   defied.

   ^46This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite
   thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of
   the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to
   the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is
   a God in Israel.

   ^47And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword
   and spear: for the battle is the Lord'S, and he will give you into our
   hands.

   ^48And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew
   nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet
   the Philistine.

   ^49And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and
   slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk
   into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.

   ^50So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a
   stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword
   in the hand of David.

   ^51Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his
   sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off
   his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was
   dead, they fled.

   ^52And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued
   the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of
   Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to
   Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.

   ^53And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the
   Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.

   ^54And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to
   Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.

   ^55And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said
   unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth?
   And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.

   ^56And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.

   ^57And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner
   took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine
   in his hand.

   ^58And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David
   answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 18

   And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul,
   that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan
   loved him as his own soul.

   ^2And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his
   father's house.

   ^3Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his
   own soul.

   ^4And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave
   it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and
   to his girdle.

   ^5And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself
   wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in
   the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.

   ^6And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the
   slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of
   Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy,
   and with instruments of musick.

   ^7And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul
   hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.

   ^8And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said,
   They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have
   ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?

   ^9And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.

   ^10And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God
   came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David
   played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in
   Saul's hand.

   ^11And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to
   the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.

   ^12And Saul was afraid of David, because the Lord was with him, and was
   departed from Saul.

   ^13Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a
   thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.

   ^14And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the Lord was
   with him.

   ^15Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was
   afraid of him.

   ^16But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came
   in before them.

   ^17And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I
   give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the Lord'S
   battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand
   of the Philistines be upon him.

   ^18And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my
   father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?

   ^19But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should
   have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the
   Meholathite to wife.

   ^20And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the
   thing pleased him.

   ^21And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him,
   and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul
   said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the
   twain.

   ^22And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David
   secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his
   servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law.

   ^23And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And
   David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law,
   seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?

   ^24And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake
   David.

   ^25And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any
   dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of
   the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of
   the Philistines.

   ^26And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well
   to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired.

   ^27Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the
   Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and
   they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's
   son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.

   ^28And Saul saw and knew that the Lord was with David, and that Michal
   Saul's daughter loved him.

   ^29And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's
   enemy continually.

   ^30Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass,
   after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all
   the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 19

   And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they
   should kill David.

   ^2But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told
   David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I
   pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a
   secret place, and hide thyself:

   ^3And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou
   art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I
   will tell thee.

   ^4And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto
   him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because
   he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works have been to
   thee-ward very good:

   ^5For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the
   Lord wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and
   didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to
   slay David without a cause?

   ^6And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the
   Lord liveth, he shall not be slain.

   ^7And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things.
   And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in
   times past.

   ^8And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the
   Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from
   him.

   ^9And the evil spirit from the Lord was upon Saul, as he sat in his
   house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand.

   ^10And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin;
   but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin
   into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night.

   ^11Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to
   slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If
   thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain.

   ^12So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled,
   and escaped.

   ^13And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pillow
   of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth.

   ^14And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.

   ^15And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him
   up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.

   ^16And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in
   the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his bolster.

   ^17And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent
   away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said
   unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?

   ^18So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told
   him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in
   Naioth.

   ^19And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.

   ^20And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the
   company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as appointed
   over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they
   also prophesied.

   ^21And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they
   prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and
   they prophesied also.

   ^22Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is in
   Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said,
   Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.

   ^23And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was
   upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth
   in Ramah.

   ^24And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel
   in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night.
   Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?

    Chapter Samuel 20

   And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan,
   What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy
   father, that he seeketh my life?

   ^2And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my
   father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it
   me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.

   ^3And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that
   I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know
   this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul
   liveth, there is but a step between me and death.

   ^4Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will
   even do it for thee.

   ^5And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and
   I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I
   may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.

   ^6If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave
   of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly
   sacrifice there for all the family.

   ^7If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he
   be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.

   ^8Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast
   brought thy servant into a covenant of the Lord with thee:
   notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why
   shouldest thou bring me to thy father?

   ^9And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that
   evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I
   tell it thee?

   ^10Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy
   father answer thee roughly?

   ^11And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the
   field. And they went out both of them into the field.

   ^12And Jonathan said unto David, O Lord God of Israel, when I have
   sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and,
   behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee,
   and shew it thee;

   ^13The Lord do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father
   to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that
   thou mayest go in peace: and the Lord be with thee, as he hath been
   with my father.

   ^14And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the
   Lord, that I die not:

   ^15But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever:
   no, not when the Lord hath cut off the enemies of David every one from
   the face of the earth.

   ^16So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the
   Lord even require it at the hand of David's enemies.

   ^17And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for
   he loved him as he loved his own soul.

   ^18Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou
   shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.

   ^19And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down
   quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the
   business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.

   ^20And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot
   at a mark.

   ^21And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If
   I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of
   thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no
   hurt; as the Lord liveth.

   ^22But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond
   thee; go thy way: for the Lord hath sent thee away.

   ^23And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold,
   the Lord be between thee and me for ever.

   ^24So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come,
   the king sat him down to eat meat.

   ^25And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat
   by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and
   David's place was empty.

   ^26Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought,
   Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.

   ^27And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the
   month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his
   son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday,
   nor to day?

   ^28And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go
   to Bethlehem:

   ^29And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice
   in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now,
   if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and
   see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.

   ^30Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto
   him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou
   hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the
   confusion of thy mother's nakedness?

   ^31For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt
   not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him
   unto me, for he shall surely die.

   ^32And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore
   shall he be slain? what hath he done?

   ^33And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew
   that it was determined of his father to slay David.

   ^34So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no
   meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because
   his father had done him shame.

   ^35And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the
   field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.

   ^36And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I
   shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.

   ^37And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan
   had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow
   beyond thee?

   ^38And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And
   Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.

   ^39But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the
   matter.

   ^40And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go,
   carry them to the city.

   ^41And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward
   the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three
   times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until
   David exceeded.

   ^42And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn
   both of us in the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord be between me and
   thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and
   departed: and Jonathan went into the city.

    Chapter Samuel 21

   Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was
   afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone,
   and no man with thee?

   ^2And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me
   a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the
   business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I
   have appointed my servants to such and such a place.

   ^3Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread
   in mine hand, or what there is present.

   ^4And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread
   under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have
   kept themselves at least from women.

   ^5And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women
   have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and
   the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner
   common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.

   ^6So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there
   but the shewbread, that was taken from before the Lord, to put hot
   bread in the day when it was taken away.

   ^7Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
   detained before the Lord; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the
   chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.

   ^8And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand
   spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with
   me, because the king's business required haste.

   ^9And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou
   slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth
   behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no
   other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it
   me.

   ^10And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to
   Achish the king of Gath.

   ^11And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king
   of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying,
   Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?

   ^12And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of
   Achish the king of Gath.

   ^13And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in
   their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his
   spittle fall down upon his beard.

   ^14Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad:
   wherefore then have ye brought him to me?

   ^15Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the
   mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 22

   David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and
   when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down
   thither to him.

   ^2And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt,
   and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and
   he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four
   hundred men.

   ^3And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of
   Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with
   you, till I know what God will do for me.

   ^4And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him
   all the while that David was in the hold.

   ^5And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart,
   and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into
   the forest of Hareth.

   ^6When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with
   him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear
   in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him;)

   ^7Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye
   Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and
   vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of
   hundreds;

   ^8That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that
   sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and
   there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my
   son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this
   day?

   ^9Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of
   Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the
   son of Ahitub.

   ^10And he enquired of the Lord for him, and gave him victuals, and gave
   him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.

   ^11Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub,
   and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came
   all of them to the king.

   ^12And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I
   am, my lord.

   ^13And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and
   the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and
   hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in
   wait, as at this day?

   ^14Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful
   among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and
   goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?

   ^15Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let
   not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of
   my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.

   ^16And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all
   thy father's house.

   ^17And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and
   slay the priests of the Lord; because their hand also is with David,
   and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the
   servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the
   priests of the Lord.

   ^18And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And
   Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that
   day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.

   ^19And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the
   sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses,
   and sheep, with the edge of the sword.

   ^20And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar,
   escaped, and fled after David.

   ^21And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the Lord'S priests.

   ^22And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the
   Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned
   the death of all the persons of thy father's house.

   ^23Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh
   thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 23

   Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against
   Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.

   ^2Therefore David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go and smite
   these Philistines? And the Lord said unto David, Go, and smite the
   Philistines, and save Keilah.

   ^3And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah:
   how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the
   Philistines?

   ^4Then David enquired of the Lord yet again. And the Lord answered him
   and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines
   into thine hand.

   ^5So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines,
   and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter.
   So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.

   ^6And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David
   to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.

   ^7And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said,
   God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering
   into a town that hath gates and bars.

   ^8And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah,
   to besiege David and his men.

   ^9And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and
   he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod.

   ^10Then said David, O Lord God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly
   heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my
   sake.

   ^11Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come
   down, as thy servant hath heard? O Lord God of Israel, I beseech thee,
   tell thy servant. And the Lord said, He will come down.

   ^12Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into
   the hand of Saul? And the Lord said, They will deliver thee up.

   ^13Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and
   departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it
   was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go
   forth.

   ^14And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a
   mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but
   God delivered him not into his hand.

   ^15And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David was
   in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.

   ^16And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and
   strengthened his hand in God.

   ^17And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall
   not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next
   unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.

   ^18And they two made a covenant before the Lord: and David abode in the
   wood, and Jonathan went to his house.

   ^19Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David
   hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of
   Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?

   ^20Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy
   soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's
   hand.

   ^21And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the Lord; for ye have compassion on
   me.

   ^22Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his
   haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he
   dealeth very subtilly.

   ^23See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he
   hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will
   go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I
   will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.

   ^24And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men
   were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon.

   ^25Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David:
   wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of
   Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the
   wilderness of Maon.

   ^26And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on
   that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of
   Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to
   take them.

   ^27But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come;
   for the Philistines have invaded the land.

   ^28Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against
   the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.

   ^29And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 24

   And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the
   Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the
   wilderness of Engedi.

   ^2Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went
   to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.

   ^3And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul
   went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides
   of the cave.

   ^4And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the Lord
   said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand,
   that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David
   arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.

   ^5And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because
   he had cut off Saul's skirt.

   ^6And he said unto his men, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing
   unto my master, the Lord'S anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against
   him, seeing he is the anointed of the Lord.

   ^7So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not
   to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his
   way.

   ^8David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after
   Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David
   stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.

   ^9And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying,
   Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?

   ^10Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the Lord had
   delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill
   thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine
   hand against my lord; for he is the Lord'S anointed.

   ^11Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand:
   for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know
   thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand,
   and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take
   it.

   ^12The Lord judge between me and thee, and the Lord avenge me of thee:
   but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

   ^13As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the
   wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

   ^14After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou
   pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.

   ^15The Lord therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see,
   and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.

   ^16And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these
   words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And
   Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.

   ^17And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast
   rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.

   ^18And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me:
   forasmuch as when the Lord had delivered me into thine hand, thou
   killedst me not.

   ^19For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore
   the Lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.

   ^20And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and
   that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.

   ^21Swear now therefore unto me by the Lord, that thou wilt not cut off
   my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my
   father's house.

   ^22And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men
   gat them up unto the hold.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 25

   And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and
   lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose,
   and went down to the wilderness of Paran.

   ^2And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and
   the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand
   goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

   ^3Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail:
   and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful
   countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he
   was of the house of Caleb.

   ^4And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.

   ^5And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men,
   Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:

   ^6And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both
   to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou
   hast.

   ^7And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which
   were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto
   them, all the while they were in Carmel.

   ^8Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young
   men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray
   thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son
   David.

   ^9And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all
   those words in the name of David, and ceased.

   ^10And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who
   is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away
   every man from his master.

   ^11Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have
   killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence
   they be?

   ^12So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and
   told him all those sayings.

   ^13And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And
   they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword:
   and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred
   abode by the stuff.

   ^14But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold,
   David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and
   he railed on them.

   ^15But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither
   missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we
   were in the fields:

   ^16They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we
   were with them keeping the sheep.

   ^17Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is
   determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is
   such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.

   ^18Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two
   bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of
   parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes
   of figs, and laid them on asses.

   ^19And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come
   after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.

   ^20And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the
   covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against
   her; and she met them.

   ^21Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow
   hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that
   pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.

   ^22So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all
   that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the
   wall.

   ^23And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and
   fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,

   ^24And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this
   iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine
   audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.

   ^25Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal:
   for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him:
   but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst
   send.

   ^26Now therefore, my lord, as the Lord liveth, and as thy soul liveth,
   seeing the Lord hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and
   from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and
   they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.

   ^27And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my
   lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.

   ^28I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the Lord
   will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the
   battles of the Lord, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.

   ^29Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the
   soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy
   God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of
   the middle of a sling.

   ^30And it shall come to pass, when the Lord shall have done to my lord
   according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and
   shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;

   ^31That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my
   lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath
   avenged himself: but when the Lord shall have dealt well with my lord,
   then remember thine handmaid.

   ^32And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which
   sent thee this day to meet me:

   ^33And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me
   this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine
   own hand.

   ^34For in very deed, as the Lord God of Israel liveth, which hath kept
   me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet
   me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any
   that pisseth against the wall.

   ^35So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and
   said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to
   thy voice, and have accepted thy person.

   ^36And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his
   house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within
   him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or
   more, until the morning light.

   ^37But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of
   Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died
   within him, and he became as a stone.

   ^38And it came to pass about ten days after, that the Lord smote Nabal,
   that he died.

   ^39And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the
   Lord, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of
   Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the Lord hath returned
   the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed
   with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.

   ^40And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they
   spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to
   wife.

   ^41And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said,
   Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the
   servants of my lord.

   ^42And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five
   damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers
   of David, and became his wife.

   ^43David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them
   his wives.

   ^44But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the
   son of Laish, which was of Gallim.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 26

   And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide
   himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?

   ^2Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having
   three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the
   wilderness of Ziph.

   ^3And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon,
   by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul
   came after him into the wilderness.

   ^4David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in
   very deed.

   ^5And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and
   David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the
   captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched
   round about him.

   ^6Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai
   the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me
   to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.

   ^7So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul
   lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at
   his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.

   ^8Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine
   hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the
   spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second
   time.

   ^9And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth
   his hand against the Lord'S anointed, and be guiltless?

   ^10David said furthermore, As the Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite
   him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and
   perish.

   ^11The Lord forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the
   Lord'S anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at
   his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.

   ^12So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster;
   and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked:
   for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the Lord was fallen
   upon them.

   ^13Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an
   hill afar off; a great space being between them:

   ^14And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying,
   Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou
   that criest to the king?

   ^15And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like
   to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king?
   for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.

   ^16This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the Lord liveth, ye
   are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the Lord'S
   anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water
   that was at his bolster.

   ^17And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son
   David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.

   ^18And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant?
   for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?

   ^19Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of
   his servant. If the Lord have stirred thee up against me, let him
   accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they
   before the Lord; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in
   the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go, serve other gods.

   ^20Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of
   the Lord: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when
   one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.

   ^21Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no
   more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day:
   behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.

   ^22And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of
   the young men come over and fetch it.

   ^23The Lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness:
   for the Lord delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not
   stretch forth mine hand against the Lord'S anointed.

   ^24And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so
   let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord, and let him deliver
   me out of all tribulation.

   ^25Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt
   both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on
   his way, and Saul returned to his place.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 27

   And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of
   Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape
   into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek
   me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.

   ^2And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that
   were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.

   ^3And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with
   his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess,
   and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.

   ^4And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no
   more again for him.

   ^5And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes,
   let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell
   there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?

   ^6Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth
   unto the kings of Judah unto this day.

   ^7And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a
   full year and four months.

   ^8And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the
   Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the
   inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of
   Egypt.

   ^9And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and
   took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and
   the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish.

   ^10And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said,
   Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites,
   and against the south of the Kenites.

   ^11And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to
   Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so
   will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the
   Philistines.

   ^12And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel
   utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 28

   And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their
   armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto
   David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle,
   thou and thy men.

   ^2And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can
   do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine
   head for ever.

   ^3Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him
   in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had
   familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.

   ^4And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and
   pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they
   pitched in Gilboa.

   ^5And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his
   heart greatly trembled.

   ^6And when Saul enquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him not,
   neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.

   ^7Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a
   familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his
   servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar
   spirit at Endor.

   ^8And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went,
   and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said,
   I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him
   up, whom I shall name unto thee.

   ^9And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath
   done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the
   wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my
   life, to cause me to die?

   ^10And Saul sware to her by the Lord, saying, As the Lord liveth, there
   shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.

   ^11Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said,
   Bring me up Samuel.

   ^12And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the
   woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art
   Saul.

   ^13And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And
   the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.

   ^14And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man
   cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it
   was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed
   himself.

   ^15And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me
   up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make
   war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more,
   neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that
   thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.

   ^16Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the
   Lord is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?

   ^17And the Lord hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the Lord hath
   rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even
   to David:

   ^18Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the Lord, nor executedst his
   fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the Lord done this thing unto
   thee this day.

   ^19Moreover the Lord will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand
   of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me:
   the Lord also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the
   Philistines.

   ^20Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore
   afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in
   him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.

   ^21And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and
   said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have
   put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou
   spakest unto me.

   ^22Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of
   thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat,
   that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.

   ^23But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together
   with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he
   arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.

   ^24And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and
   killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened
   bread thereof:

   ^25And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they
   did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 29

   Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and
   the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.

   ^2And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by
   thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.

   ^3Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here?
   And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David,
   the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these
   days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell
   unto me unto this day?

   ^4And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the
   princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that
   he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him
   not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to
   us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should
   it not be with the heads of these men?

   ^5Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances,
   saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?

   ^6Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the Lord
   liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in
   with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in
   thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless
   the lords favour thee not.

   ^7Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the
   lords of the Philistines.

   ^8And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou
   found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day,
   that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?

   ^9And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in
   my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the
   Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.

   ^10Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's
   servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the
   morning, and have light, depart.

   ^11So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to
   return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to
   Jezreel.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 30

   And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the
   third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and
   smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;

   ^2And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not
   any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their
   way.

   ^3So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned
   with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were
   taken captives.

   ^4Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice
   and wept, until they had no more power to weep.

   ^5And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess,
   and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

   ^6And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning
   him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his
   sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the Lord
   his God.

   ^7And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee,
   bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to
   David.

   ^8And David enquired at the Lord, saying, Shall I pursue after this
   troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou
   shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.

   ^9So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and
   came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.

   ^10But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode
   behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook
   Besor.

   ^11And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David,
   and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;

   ^12And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of
   raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he
   had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.

   ^13And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art
   thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite;
   and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.

   ^14We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the
   coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we
   burned Ziklag with fire.

   ^15And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And
   he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor
   deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to
   this company.

   ^16And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad
   upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all
   the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines,
   and out of the land of Judah.

   ^17And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the
   next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young
   men, which rode upon camels, and fled.

   ^18And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and
   David rescued his two wives.

   ^19And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great,
   neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had
   taken to them: David recovered all.

   ^20And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before
   those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.

   ^21And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they
   could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook
   Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that
   were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.

   ^22Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that
   went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not
   give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man
   his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.

   ^23Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which
   the Lord hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the
   company that came against us into our hand.

   ^24For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is
   that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by
   the stuff: they shall part alike.

   ^25And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and
   an ordinance for Israel unto this day.

   ^26And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders
   of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the
   spoil of the enemies of the Lord;

   ^27To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south
   Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,

   ^28And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth,
   and to them which were in Eshtemoa,

   ^29And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the
   cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of
   the Kenites,

   ^30And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in
   Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,

   ^31And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David
   himself and his men were wont to haunt.

   Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled
   from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.

   ^2And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and
   the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's
   sons.

   ^3And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and
   he was sore wounded of the archers.

   ^4Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me
   through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through,
   and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid.
   Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

   ^5And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise
   upon his sword, and died with him.

   ^6So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his
   men, that same day together.

   ^7And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley,
   and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel
   fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities,
   and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.

   ^8And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip
   the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount
   Gilboa.

   ^9And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into
   the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of
   their idols, and among the people.

   ^10And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened
   his body to the wall of Bethshan.

   ^11And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the
   Philistines had done to Saul;

   ^12All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of
   Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to
   Jabesh, and burnt them there.

   ^13And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh,
   and fasted seven days.

    Chapter Samuel 1

   Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned
   from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in
   Ziklag;

   ^2It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out
   of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head:
   and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and
   did obeisance.

   ^3And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto
   him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.

   ^4And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me.
   And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of
   the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are
   dead also.

   ^5And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou
   that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?

   ^6And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon
   mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots
   and horsemen followed hard after him.

   ^7And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I
   answered, Here am I.

   ^8And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an
   Amalekite.

   ^9He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for
   anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.

   ^10So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could
   not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon
   his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them
   hither unto my lord.

   ^11Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all
   the men that were with him:

   ^12And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for
   Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of
   Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.

   ^13And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou?
   And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.

   ^14And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth
   thine hand to destroy the Lord'S anointed?

   ^15And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall
   upon him. And he smote him that he died.

   ^16And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth
   hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the Lord'S anointed.

   ^17And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan
   his son:

   ^18(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow:
   behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)

   ^19The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the
   mighty fallen!

   ^20Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest
   the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the
   uncircumcised triumph.

   ^21Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be
   rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the
   mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not
   been anointed with oil.

   ^22From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of
   Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.

   ^23Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in
   their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they
   were stronger than lions.

   ^24Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet,
   with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.

   ^25How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan,
   thou wast slain in thine high places.

   ^26I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast
   thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of
   women.

   ^27How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

    Chapter Samuel 2

   And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the Lord,
   saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the Lord
   said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he
   said, Unto Hebron.

   ^2So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the
   Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.

   ^3And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his
   household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.

   ^4And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over
   the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of
   Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.

   ^5And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto
   them, Blessed be ye of the Lord, that ye have shewed this kindness unto
   your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.

   ^6And now the Lord shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will
   requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.

   ^7Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for
   your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me
   king over them.

   ^8But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the
   son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;

   ^9And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over
   Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.

   ^10Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign
   over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed
   David.

   ^11And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah
   was seven years and six months.

   ^12And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of
   Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

   ^13And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out,
   and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on
   the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.

   ^14And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before
   us. And Joab said, Let them arise.

   ^15Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which
   pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of
   David.

   ^16And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his
   sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that
   place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.

   ^17And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and
   the men of Israel, before the servants of David.

   ^18And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and
   Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.

   ^19And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the
   right hand nor to the left from following Abner.

   ^20Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he
   answered, I am.

   ^21And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy
   left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his
   armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.

   ^22And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me:
   wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up
   my face to Joab thy brother?

   ^23Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder
   end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out
   behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it
   came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down
   and died stood still.

   ^24Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down
   when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the
   way of the wilderness of Gibeon.

   ^25And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after
   Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.

   ^26Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for
   ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end?
   how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from
   following their brethren?

   ^27And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then
   in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his
   brother.

   ^28So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued
   after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.

   ^29And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and
   passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to
   Mahanaim.

   ^30And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all
   the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and
   Asahel.

   ^31But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's
   men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.

   ^32And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his
   father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night,
   and they came to Hebron at break of day.

    Chapter Samuel 3

   Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of
   David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul
   waxed weaker and weaker.

   ^2And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon,
   of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;

   ^3And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite;
   and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of
   Geshur;

   ^4And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth,
   Shephatiah the son of Abital;

   ^5And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to
   David in Hebron.

   ^6And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul
   and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of
   Saul.

   ^7And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of
   Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my
   father's concubine?

   ^8Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I
   a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the
   house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have
   not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day
   with a fault concerning this woman?

   ^9So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the Lord hath sworn to
   David, even so I do to him;

   ^10To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the
   throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.

   ^11And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.

   ^12And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is
   the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand
   shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.

   ^13And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I
   require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first
   bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.

   ^14And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver
   me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of
   the Philistines.

   ^15And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
   Phaltiel the son of Laish.

   ^16And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim.
   Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.

   ^17And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye
   sought for David in times past to be king over you:

   ^18Now then do it: for the Lord hath spoken of David, saying, By the
   hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand
   of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.

   ^19And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to
   speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel,
   and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.

   ^20So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David
   made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.

   ^21And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all
   Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee,
   and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And
   David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.

   ^22And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a
   troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with
   David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.

   ^23When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told
   Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent
   him away, and he is gone in peace.

   ^24Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold,
   Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is
   quite gone?

   ^25Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and
   to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou
   doest.

   ^26And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after
   Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew
   it not.

   ^27And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the
   gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth
   rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.

   ^28And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are
   guiltless before the Lord for ever from the blood of Abner the son of
   Ner:

   ^29Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and
   let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or
   that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the
   sword, or that lacketh bread.

   ^30So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain
   their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.

   ^31And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him,
   Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.
   And king David himself followed the bier.

   ^32And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice,
   and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.

   ^33And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool
   dieth?

   ^34Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man
   falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept
   again over him.

   ^35And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was
   yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I
   taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.

   ^36And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as
   whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.

   ^37For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was
   not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.

   ^38And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a
   prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?

   ^39And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons
   of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the Lord shall reward the doer of evil
   according to his wickedness.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 4

   And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were
   feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.

   ^2And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of
   the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of
   Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was
   reckoned to Benjamin:

   ^3And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until
   this day.)

   ^4And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was
   five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of
   Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as
   she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was
   Mephibosheth.

   ^5And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and
   came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a
   bed at noon.

   ^6And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they
   would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and
   Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.

   ^7For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his
   bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and
   took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.

   ^8And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and
   said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine
   enemy, which sought thy life; and the Lord hath avenged my lord the
   king this day of Saul, and of his seed.

   ^9And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon
   the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the Lord liveth, who hath
   redeemed my soul out of all adversity,

   ^10When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have
   brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who
   thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:

   ^11How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his
   own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of
   your hand, and take you away from the earth?

   ^12And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off
   their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron.
   But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of
   Abner in Hebron.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 5

   Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake,
   saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

   ^2Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that
   leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the Lord said to thee, Thou
   shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.

   ^3So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king
   David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord: and they
   anointed David king over Israel.

   ^4David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
   forty years.

   ^5In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in
   Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.

   ^6And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the
   inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou
   take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither:
   thinking, David cannot come in hither.

   ^7Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city
   of David.

   ^8And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and
   smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, that are hated of
   David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The
   blind and the lame shall not come into the house.

   ^9So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And
   David built round about from Millo and inward.

   ^10And David went on, and grew great, and the Lord God of hosts was
   with him.

   ^11And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees,
   and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.

   ^12And David perceived that the Lord had established him king over
   Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's
   sake.

   ^13And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after
   he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to
   David.

   ^14And these be the names of those that were born unto him in
   Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,

   ^15Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

   ^16And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.

   ^17But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king
   over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard
   of it, and went down to the hold.

   ^18The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of
   Rephaim.

   ^19And David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up to the
   Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the Lord said
   unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into
   thine hand.

   ^20And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said,
   The Lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach
   of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.

   ^21And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.

   ^22And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the
   valley of Rephaim.

   ^23And when David enquired of the Lord, he said, Thou shalt not go up;
   but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the
   mulberry trees.

   ^24And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of
   the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall
   the Lord go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.

   ^25And David did so, as the Lord had commanded him; and smote the
   Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 6

   Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty
   thousand.

   ^2And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from
   Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is
   called by the name of the Lord of hosts that dwelleth between the
   cherubims.

   ^3And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of
   the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons
   of Abinadab, drave the new cart.

   ^4And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah,
   accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.

   ^5And David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord on all
   manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on
   psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.

   ^6And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his
   hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.

   ^7And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote
   him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.

   ^8And David was displeased, because the Lord had made a breach upon
   Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.

   ^9And David was afraid of the Lord that day, and said, How shall the
   ark of the Lord come to me?

   ^10So David would not remove the ark of the Lord unto him into the city
   of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the
   Gittite.

   ^11And the ark of the Lord continued in the house of Obededom the
   Gittite three months: and the Lord blessed Obededom, and all his
   household.

   ^12And it was told king David, saying, The Lord hath blessed the house
   of Obed- edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of
   God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of
   Obededom into the city of David with gladness.

   ^13And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the Lord had gone
   six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.

   ^14And David danced before the Lord with all his might; and David was
   girded with a linen ephod.

   ^15So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord
   with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.

   ^16And as the ark of the Lord came into the city of David, Michal
   Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and
   dancing before the Lord; and she despised him in her heart.

   ^17And they brought in the ark of the Lord, and set it in his place, in
   the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David
   offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord.

   ^18And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and
   peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of
   hosts.

   ^19And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of
   Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and
   a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed
   every one to his house.

   ^20Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter
   of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of
   Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the
   handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly
   uncovereth himself!

   ^21And David said unto Michal, It was before the Lord, which chose me
   before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over
   the people of the Lord, over Israel: therefore will I play before the
   Lord.

   ^22And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own
   sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall
   I be had in honour.

   ^23Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of
   her death.

    Chapter Samuel 7

   And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the Lord had
   given him rest round about from all his enemies;

   ^2That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an
   house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.

   ^3And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for
   the Lord is with thee.

   ^4And it came to pass that night, that the word of the Lord came unto
   Nathan, saying,

   ^5Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the Lord, Shalt thou build
   me an house for me to dwell in?

   ^6Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought
   up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have
   walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.

   ^7In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of
   Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I
   commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an
   house of cedar?

   ^8Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the
   Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the
   sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:

   ^9And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all
   thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like
   unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.

   ^10Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant
   them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more;
   neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as
   beforetime,

   ^11And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people
   Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the
   Lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house.

   ^12And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy
   fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of
   thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.

   ^13He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne
   of his kingdom for ever.

   ^14I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity,
   I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the
   children of men:

   ^15But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul,
   whom I put away before thee.

   ^16And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before
   thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.

   ^17According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so
   did Nathan speak unto David.

   ^18Then went king David in, and sat before the Lord, and he said, Who
   am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me
   hitherto?

   ^19And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou
   hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And
   is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?

   ^20And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest
   thy servant.

   ^21For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou
   done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.

   ^22Wherefore thou art great, O Lord God: for there is none like thee,
   neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have
   heard with our ears.

   ^23And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like
   Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make
   him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land,
   before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the
   nations and their gods?

   ^24For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people
   unto thee for ever: and thou, Lord, art become their God.

   ^25And now, O Lord God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy
   servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as
   thou hast said.

   ^26And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The Lord of hosts is
   the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be
   established before thee.

   ^27For thou, O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy
   servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant
   found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.

   ^28And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and
   thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:

   ^29Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant,
   that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast
   spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be
   blessed for ever.

    Chapter Samuel 8

   And after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and
   subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the
   Philistines.

   ^2And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down
   to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and
   with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's
   servants, and brought gifts.

   ^3David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he
   went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.

   ^4And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred
   horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the
   chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.

   ^5And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of
   Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.

   ^6Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became
   servants to David, and brought gifts. And the Lord preserved David
   whithersoever he went.

   ^7And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of
   Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

   ^8And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David
   took exceeding much brass.

   ^9When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of
   Hadadezer,

   ^10Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to
   bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him:
   for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of
   silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:

   ^11Which also king David did dedicate unto the Lord, with the silver
   and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;

   ^12Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the
   Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of
   Rehob, king of Zobah.

   ^13And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the
   Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.

   ^14And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons,
   and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the Lord preserved
   David whithersoever he went.

   ^15And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and
   justice unto all his people.

   ^16And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the
   son of Ahilud was recorder;

   ^17And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were
   the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;

   ^18And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and
   the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.

    Chapter Samuel 9

   And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul,
   that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?

   ^2And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And
   when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou
   Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.

   ^3And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I
   may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king,
   Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.

   ^4And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king,
   Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.

   ^5Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the
   son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.

   ^6Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come
   unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said,
   Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!

   ^7And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee
   kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the
   land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table
   continually.

   ^8And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou
   shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?

   ^9Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I
   have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all
   his house.

   ^10Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land
   for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may
   have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread
   alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.

   ^11Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king
   hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for
   Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the
   king's sons.

   ^12And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that
   dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.

   ^13So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at
   the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.

    Chapter Samuel 10

   And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon
   died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.

   ^2Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash,
   as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by
   the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into
   the land of the children of Ammon.

   ^3And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord,
   Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent
   comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto
   thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?

   ^4Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of
   their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their
   buttocks, and sent them away.

   ^5When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men
   were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your
   beards be grown, and then return.

   ^6And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the
   children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob, and the
   Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand
   men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.

   ^7And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the
   mighty men.

   ^8And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at
   the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and
   Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.

   ^9When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and
   behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array
   against the Syrians:

   ^10And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his
   brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.

   ^11And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt
   help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I
   will come and help thee.

   ^12Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for
   the cities of our God: and the Lord do that which seemeth him good.

   ^13And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the
   battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.

   ^14And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then
   fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab
   returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.

   ^15And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they
   gathered themselves together.

   ^16And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the
   river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of
   Hadarezer went before them.

   ^17And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and
   passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves
   in array against David, and fought with him.

   ^18And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven
   hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote
   Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.

   ^19And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they
   were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served
   them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 11

   And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings
   go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him,
   and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged
   Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.

   ^2And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his
   bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he
   saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look
   upon.

   ^3And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not
   this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?

   ^4And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him,
   and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she
   returned unto her house.

   ^5And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with
   child.

   ^6And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab
   sent Uriah to David.

   ^7And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did,
   and how the people did, and how the war prospered.

   ^8And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And
   Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess
   of meat from the king.

   ^9But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants
   of his lord, and went not down to his house.

   ^10And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his
   house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why
   then didst thou not go down unto thine house?

   ^11And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in
   tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in
   the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink,
   and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will
   not do this thing.

   ^12And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I
   will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the
   morrow.

   ^13And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and
   he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the
   servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.

   ^14And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to
   Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.

   ^15And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of
   the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and
   die.

   ^16And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned
   Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.

   ^17And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there
   fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite
   died also.

   ^18Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;

   ^19And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of
   telling the matters of the war unto the king,

   ^20And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee,
   Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew
   ye not that they would shoot from the wall?

   ^21Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a
   piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez?
   why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite
   is dead also.

   ^22So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had
   sent him for.

   ^23And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against
   us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even
   unto the entering of the gate.

   ^24And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some
   of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is
   dead also.

   ^25Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab,
   Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well
   as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow
   it: and encourage thou him.

   ^26And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead,
   she mourned for her husband.

   ^27And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his
   house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that
   David had done displeased the Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 12

   And the Lord sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said
   unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other
   poor.

   ^2The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:

   ^3But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had
   bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his
   children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay
   in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.

   ^4And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take
   of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man
   that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it
   for the man that was come to him.

   ^5And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to
   Nathan, As the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall
   surely die:

   ^6And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing,
   and because he had no pity.

   ^7And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the Lord God
   of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out
   of the hand of Saul;

   ^8And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy
   bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had
   been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such
   things.

   ^9Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord, to do evil
   in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and
   hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword
   of the children of Ammon.

   ^10Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because
   thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to
   be thy wife.

   ^11Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out
   of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and
   give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the
   sight of this sun.

   ^12For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all
   Israel, and before the sun.

   ^13And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord. And
   Nathan said unto David, The Lord also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt
   not die.

   ^14Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the
   enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee
   shall surely die.

   ^15And Nathan departed unto his house. And the Lord struck the child
   that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.

   ^16David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and
   went in, and lay all night upon the earth.

   ^17And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up
   from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.

   ^18And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the
   servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they
   said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he
   would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we
   tell him that the child is dead?

   ^19But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that
   the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the
   child dead? And they said, He is dead.

   ^20Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself,
   and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the Lord, and
   worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they
   set bread before him, and he did eat.

   ^21Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast
   done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but
   when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.

   ^22And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I
   said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child
   may live?

   ^23But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back
   again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.

   ^24And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and
   lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and
   the Lord loved him.

   ^25And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his
   name Jedidiah, because of the Lord.

   ^26And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took
   the royal city.

   ^27And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against
   Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.

   ^28Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp
   against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called
   after my name.

   ^29And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and
   fought against it, and took it.

   ^30And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof
   was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on
   David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great
   abundance.

   ^31And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them
   under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made
   them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of
   the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto
   Jerusalem.

    Chapter Samuel 13

   And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a
   fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved
   her.

   ^2And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for
   she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to
   her.

   ^3But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah
   David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.

   ^4And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from
   day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love
   Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.

   ^5And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself
   sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray
   thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in
   my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.

   ^6So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come
   to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister
   come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her
   hand.

   ^7Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's
   house, and dress him meat.

   ^8So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And
   she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did
   bake the cakes.

   ^9And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to
   eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every
   man from him.

   ^10And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I
   may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and
   brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.

   ^11And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her,
   and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.

   ^12And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such
   thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.

   ^13And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou
   shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee,
   speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.

   ^14Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger
   than she, forced her, and lay with her.

   ^15Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he
   hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And
   Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.

   ^16And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me
   away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would
   not hearken unto her.

   ^17Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put
   now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.

   ^18And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such
   robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his
   servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.

   ^19And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers
   colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on
   crying.

   ^20And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been
   with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard
   not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's
   house.

   ^21But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.

   ^22And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for
   Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.

   ^23And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had
   sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom
   invited all the king's sons.

   ^24And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath
   sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with
   thy servant.

   ^25And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go,
   lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would
   not go, but blessed him.

   ^26Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with
   us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?

   ^27But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons
   go with him.

   ^28Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when
   Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon;
   then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and
   be valiant.

   ^29And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded.
   Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule,
   and fled.

   ^30And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came
   to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is
   not one of them left.

   ^31Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth;
   and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.

   ^32And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said,
   Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the
   king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom
   this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.

   ^33Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart,
   to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.

   ^34But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up
   his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of
   the hill side behind him.

   ^35And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy
   servant said, so it is.

   ^36And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking,
   that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept:
   and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.

   ^37But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of
   Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.

   ^38So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.

   ^39And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he
   was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 14

   Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward
   Absalom.

   ^2And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said
   unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now
   mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman
   that had a long time mourned for the dead:

   ^3And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put
   the words in her mouth.

   ^4And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face
   to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.

   ^5And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am
   indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.

   ^6And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the
   field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other,
   and slew him.

   ^7And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and
   they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him,
   for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir
   also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not
   leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.

   ^8And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give
   charge concerning thee.

   ^9And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the
   iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his
   throne be guiltless.

   ^10And the king said, Whosoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me,
   and he shall not touch thee any more.

   ^11Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the Lord thy God,
   that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any
   more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the Lord liveth, there
   shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.

   ^12Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word
   unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.

   ^13And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing
   against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one
   which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his
   banished.

   ^14For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which
   cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet
   doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.

   ^15Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the
   king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid
   said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will
   perform the request of his handmaid.

   ^16For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of
   the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the
   inheritance of God.

   ^17Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be
   comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern
   good and bad: therefore the Lord thy God will be with thee.

   ^18Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I
   pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my
   lord the king now speak.

   ^19And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this?
   And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king,
   none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord
   the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all
   these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:

   ^20To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this
   thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God,
   to know all things that are in the earth.

   ^21And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go
   therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.

   ^22And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and
   thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have
   found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath
   fulfilled the request of his servant.

   ^23So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.

   ^24And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not
   see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the
   king's face.

   ^25But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom
   for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head
   there was no blemish in him.

   ^26And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he
   polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:)
   he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's
   weight.

   ^27And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose
   name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.

   ^28So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's
   face.

   ^29Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but
   he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he
   would not come.

   ^30Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine,
   and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants
   set the field on fire.

   ^31Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto
   him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?

   ^32And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come
   hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come
   from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now
   therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in
   me, let him kill me.

   ^33So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for
   Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the
   ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 15

   And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and
   horses, and fifty men to run before him.

   ^2And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and
   it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king
   for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art
   thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.

   ^3And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but
   there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.

   ^4Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that
   every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would
   do him justice!

   ^5And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him
   obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.

   ^6And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king
   for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.

   ^7And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the
   king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto
   the Lord, in Hebron.

   ^8For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying,
   If the Lord shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve
   the Lord.

   ^9And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to
   Hebron.

   ^10But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying,
   As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom
   reigneth in Hebron.

   ^11And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were
   called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.

   ^12And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor,
   from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the
   conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with
   Absalom.

   ^13And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men
   of Israel are after Absalom.

   ^14And David said unto all his servants that were with him at
   Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from
   Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring
   evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.

   ^15And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are
   ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.

   ^16And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the
   king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.

   ^17And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried
   in a place that was far off.

   ^18And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites,
   and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which
   came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.

   ^19Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also
   with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a
   stranger, and also an exile.

   ^20Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up
   and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back
   thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.

   ^21And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the Lord liveth, and as my
   lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be,
   whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.

   ^22And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite
   passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with
   him.

   ^23And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people
   passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and
   all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.

   ^24And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the
   ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and
   Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the
   city.

   ^25And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the
   city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me
   again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:

   ^26But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I,
   let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.

   ^27The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?
   return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy
   son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.

   ^28See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come
   word from you to certify me.

   ^29Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to
   Jerusalem: and they tarried there.

   ^30And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went
   up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people
   that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping
   as they went up.

   ^31And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators
   with Absalom. And David said, O Lord, I pray thee, turn the counsel of
   Ahithophel into foolishness.

   ^32And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the
   mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet
   him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:

   ^33Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be
   a burden unto me:

   ^34But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy
   servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will
   I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel
   of Ahithophel.

   ^35And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests?
   therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of
   the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.

   ^36Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's
   son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me
   every thing that ye can hear.

   ^37So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into
   Jerusalem.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 16

   And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the
   servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and
   upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of
   raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.

   ^2And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba
   said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread
   and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as
   be faint in the wilderness may drink.

   ^3And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto
   the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall
   the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.

   ^4Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto
   Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find
   grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.

   ^5And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of
   the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of
   Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.

   ^6And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David:
   and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on
   his left.

   ^7And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody
   man, and thou man of Belial:

   ^8The Lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul,
   in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the Lord hath delivered the
   kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken
   in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.

   ^9Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this
   dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take
   off his head.

   ^10And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah?
   so let him curse, because the Lord hath said unto him, Curse David. Who
   shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?

   ^11And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son,
   which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may
   this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord
   hath bidden him.

   ^12It may be that the Lord will look on mine affliction, and that the
   Lord will requite me good for his cursing this day.

   ^13And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the
   hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones
   at him, and cast dust.

   ^14And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and
   refreshed themselves there.

   ^15And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to
   Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.

   ^16And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was
   come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king,
   God save the king.

   ^17And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why
   wentest thou not with thy friend?

   ^18And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the Lord, and this
   people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him
   will I abide.

   ^19And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence
   of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in
   thy presence.

   ^20Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we
   shall do.

   ^21And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's
   concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall
   hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all
   that are with thee be strong.

   ^22So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom
   went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.

   ^23And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days,
   was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the
   counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 17

   Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve
   thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:

   ^2And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will
   make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I
   will smite the king only:

   ^3And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou
   seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.

   ^4And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.

   ^5Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear
   likewise what he saith.

   ^6And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying,
   Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying?
   if not; speak thou.

   ^7And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given
   is not good at this time.

   ^8For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be
   mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her
   whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge
   with the people.

   ^9Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it
   will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that
   whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people
   that follow Absalom.

   ^10And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion,
   shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty
   man, and they which be with him are valiant men.

   ^11Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee,
   from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for
   multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.

   ^12So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and
   we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and
   of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as
   one.

   ^13Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring
   ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be
   not one small stone found there.

   ^14And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai
   the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the Lord had
   appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that
   the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom.

   ^15Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and
   thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus
   and thus have I counselled.

   ^16Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this
   night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the
   king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.

   ^17Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be
   seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they
   went and told king David.

   ^18Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of
   them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a
   well in his court; whither they went down.

   ^19And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and
   spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.

   ^20And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they
   said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They
   be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not
   find them, they returned to Jerusalem.

   ^21And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out
   of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise,
   and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled
   against you.

   ^22Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they
   passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them
   that was not gone over Jordan.

   ^23And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he
   saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city,
   and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was
   buried in the sepulchre of his father.

   ^24Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and
   all the men of Israel with him.

   ^25And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which
   Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in
   to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.

   ^26So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.

   ^27And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the
   son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of
   Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,

   ^28Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and
   barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and
   parched pulse,

   ^29And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and
   for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is
   hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 18

   And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of
   thousands and captains of hundreds over them.

   ^2And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of
   Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah,
   Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite.
   And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you
   myself also.

   ^3But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee
   away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they
   care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now
   it is better that thou succour us out of the city.

   ^4And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the
   king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds
   and by thousands.

   ^5And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal
   gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the
   people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning
   Absalom.

   ^6So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle
   was in the wood of Ephraim;

   ^7Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David,
   and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.

   ^8For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country:
   and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.

   ^9And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule,
   and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head
   caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the
   earth; and the mule that was under him went away.

   ^10And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw
   Absalom hanged in an oak.

   ^11And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest
   him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would
   have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.

   ^12And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
   shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand
   against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and
   Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man
   Absalom.

   ^13Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for
   there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have
   set thyself against me.

   ^14Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three
   darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while
   he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.

   ^15And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote
   Absalom, and slew him.

   ^16And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing
   after Israel: for Joab held back the people.

   ^17And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood,
   and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled
   every one to his tent.

   ^18Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a
   pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep
   my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name:
   and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.

   ^19Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the
   king tidings, how that the Lord hath avenged him of his enemies.

   ^20And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but
   thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no
   tidings, because the king's son is dead.

   ^21Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And
   Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.

   ^22Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever,
   let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore
   wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?

   ^23But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then
   Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.

   ^24And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the
   roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked,
   and behold a man running alone.

   ^25And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he
   be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew
   near.

   ^26And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called
   unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the
   king said, He also bringeth tidings.

   ^27And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is
   like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is
   a good man, and cometh with good tidings.

   ^28And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell
   down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be
   the Lord thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their
   hand against my lord the king.

   ^29And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz
   answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw
   a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.

   ^30And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he
   turned aside, and stood still.

   ^31And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king:
   for the Lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up
   against thee.

   ^32And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And
   Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise
   against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.

   ^33And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the
   gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son,
   my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my
   son!
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 19

   And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for
   Absalom.

   ^2And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the
   people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for
   his son.

   ^3And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people
   being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.

   ^4But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice,
   O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!

   ^5And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed
   this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy
   life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of
   thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;

   ^6In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou
   hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor
   servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all
   we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.

   ^7Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy
   servants: for I swear by the Lord, if thou go not forth, there will not
   tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than
   all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.

   ^8Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the
   people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the
   people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.

   ^9And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of
   Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and
   he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled
   out of the land for Absalom.

   ^10And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now
   therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?

   ^11And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying,
   Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring
   the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to
   the king, even to his house.

   ^12Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are
   ye the last to bring back the king?

   ^13And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God
   do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before
   me continually in the room of Joab.

   ^14And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of
   one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and
   all thy servants.

   ^15So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal,
   to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.

   ^16And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,
   hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.

   ^17And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the
   servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty
   servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.

   ^18And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household,
   and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down
   before the king, as he was come over Jordan;

   ^19And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me,
   neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day
   that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take
   it to his heart.

   ^20For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I
   am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to
   meet my lord the king.

   ^21But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei
   be put to death for this, because he cursed the Lord'S anointed?

   ^22And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that
   ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put
   to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king
   over Israel?

   ^23Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the
   king sware unto him.

   ^24And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had
   neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his
   clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in
   peace.

   ^25And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king,
   that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me,
   Mephibosheth?

   ^26And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy
   servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go
   to the king; because thy servant is lame.

   ^27And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord
   the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine
   eyes.

   ^28For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the
   king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine
   own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the
   king?

   ^29And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy
   matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.

   ^30And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,
   forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own
   house.

   ^31And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over
   Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.

   ^32Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he
   had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he
   was a very great man.

   ^33And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will
   feed thee with me in Jerusalem.

   ^34And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I
   should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?

   ^35I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good
   and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear
   any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then
   should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?

   ^36Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why
   should the king recompense it me with such a reward?

   ^37Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in
   mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my
   mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord
   the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.

   ^38And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do
   to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt
   require of me, that will I do for thee.

   ^39And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come
   over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto
   his own place.

   ^40Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and
   all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of
   Israel.

   ^41And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto
   the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and
   have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him,
   over Jordan?

   ^42And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the
   king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter?
   have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift?

   ^43And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have
   ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye:
   why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in
   bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer
   than the words of the men of Israel.

    Chapter Samuel 20

   And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba,
   the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We
   have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse:
   every man to his tents, O Israel.

   ^2So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba
   the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from
   Jordan even to Jerusalem.

   ^3And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten
   women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them
   in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up
   unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.

   ^4Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within
   three days, and be thou here present.

   ^5So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer
   than the set time which he had appointed him.

   ^6And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us
   more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue
   after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.

   ^7And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the
   Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to
   pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

   ^8When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went
   before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him,
   and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath
   thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.

   ^9And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab took
   Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.

   ^10But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he
   smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the
   ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his
   brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.

   ^11And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth
   Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.

   ^12And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when
   the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of
   the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that
   every one that came by him stood still.

   ^13When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after
   Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

   ^14And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to
   Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and
   went also after him.

   ^15And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast
   up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the
   people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.

   ^16Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray
   you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.

   ^17And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab?
   And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of
   thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.

   ^18Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying,
   They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.

   ^19I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou
   seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow
   up the inheritance of the Lord?

   ^20And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I
   should swallow up or destroy.

   ^21The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of
   Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against
   David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman
   said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.

   ^22Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut
   off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And
   he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his
   tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.

   ^23Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of
   Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:

   ^24And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud
   was recorder:

   ^25And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:

   ^26And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 21

   Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after
   year; and David enquired of the Lord. And the Lord answered, It is for
   Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.

   ^2And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the
   Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of
   the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul
   sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)

   ^3Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?
   and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the
   inheritance of the Lord?

   ^4And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of
   Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in
   Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.

   ^5And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that
   devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of
   the coasts of Israel,

   ^6Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them
   up unto the Lord in Gibeah of Saul, whom the Lord did choose. And the
   king said, I will give them.

   ^7But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of
   Saul, because of the Lord'S oath that was between them, between David
   and Jonathan the son of Saul.

   ^8But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom
   she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of
   Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of
   Barzillai the Meholathite:

   ^9And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they
   hanged them in the hill before the Lord: and they fell all seven
   together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first
   days, in the beginning of barley harvest.

   ^10And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for
   her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped
   upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to
   rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.

   ^11And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the
   concubine of Saul, had done.

   ^12And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan
   his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the
   street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the
   Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:

   ^13And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of
   Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.

   ^14And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the
   country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and
   they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was
   intreated for the land.

   ^15Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David
   went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the
   Philistines: and David waxed faint.

   ^16And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of
   whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being
   girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.

   ^17But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the
   Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him,
   saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench
   not the light of Israel.

   ^18And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with
   the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which
   was of the sons of the giant.

   ^19And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where
   Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of
   Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.

   ^20And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great
   stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six
   toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.

   ^21And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea the brother of
   David slew him.

   ^22These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of
   David, and by the hand of his servants.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Samuel 22

   And David spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day that
   the Lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out
   of the hand of Saul:

   ^2And he said, The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;

   ^3The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the
   horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou
   savest me from violence.

   ^4I will call on the Lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be
   saved from mine enemies.

   ^5When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made
   me afraid;

   ^6The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented
   me;

   ^7In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God: and he
   did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his
   ears.

   ^8Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved
   and shook, because he was wroth.

   ^9There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth
   devoured: coals were kindled by it.

   ^10He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his
   feet.

   ^11And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the
   wings of the wind.

   ^12And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and
   thick clouds of the skies.

   ^13Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.

   ^14The Lord thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.

   ^15And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and
   discomfited them.

   ^16And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world
   were discovered, at the rebuking of the Lord, at the blast of the
   breath of his nostrils.

   ^17He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;

   ^18He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me:
   for they were too strong for me.

   ^19They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the Lord was my
   stay.

   ^20He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me,
   because he delighted in me.

   ^21The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the
   cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

   ^22For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed
   from my God.

   ^23For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did
   not depart from them.

   ^24I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine
   iniquity.

   ^25Therefore the Lord hath recompensed me according to my
   righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.

   ^26With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the
   upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.

   ^27With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou
   wilt shew thyself unsavoury.

   ^28And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the
   haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.

   ^29For thou art my lamp, O Lord: and the Lord will lighten my darkness.

   ^30For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over
   a wall.

   ^31As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the Lord is tried: he is
   a buckler to all them that trust in him.

   ^32For who is God, save the Lord? and who is a rock, save our God?

   ^33God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.

   ^34He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high
   places.

   ^35He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by
   mine arms.

   ^36Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
   gentleness hath made me great.

   ^37Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.

   ^38I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not
   again until I had consumed them.

   ^39And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not
   arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.

   ^40For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up
   against me hast thou subdued under me.

   ^41Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might
   destroy them that hate me.

   ^42They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the Lord, but he
   answered them not.

   ^43Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp
   them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.

   ^44Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou
   hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall
   serve me.

   ^45Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear,
   they shall be obedient unto me.

   ^46Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their
   close places.

   ^47The Lord liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of
   the rock of my salvation.

   ^48It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under
   me,

   ^49And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted
   me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered
   me from the violent man.

   ^50Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the heathen,
   and I will sing praises unto thy name.

   ^51He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his
   anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.

    Chapter Samuel 23

   Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and
   the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob,
   and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,

   ^2The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.

   ^3The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that
   ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.

   ^4And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth,
   even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the
   earth by clear shining after rain.

   ^5Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an
   everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all
   my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.

   ^6But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away,
   because they cannot be taken with hands:

   ^7But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the
   staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the
   same place.

   ^8These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite
   that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the
   Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one
   time.

   ^9And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the
   three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were
   there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone
   away:

   ^10He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and
   his hand clave unto the sword: and the Lord wrought a great victory
   that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.

   ^11And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the
   Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of
   ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.

   ^12But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew
   the Philistines: and the Lord wrought a great victory.

   ^13And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the
   harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines
   pitched in the valley of Rephaim.

   ^14And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines
   was then in Bethlehem.

   ^15And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the
   water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!

   ^16And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines,
   and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and
   took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink
   thereof, but poured it out unto the Lord.

   ^17And he said, Be it far from me, O Lord, that I should do this: is
   not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?
   therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty
   men.

   ^18And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief
   among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew
   them, and had the name among three.

   ^19Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain:
   howbeit he attained not unto the first three.

   ^20And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of
   Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he
   went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:

   ^21And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear
   in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the
   spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.

   ^22These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among
   three mighty men.

   ^23He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the
   first three. And David set him over his guard.

   ^24Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of
   Dodo of Bethlehem,

   ^25Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,

   ^26Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,

   ^27Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,

   ^28Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,

   ^29Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out
   of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,

   ^30Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,

   ^31Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,

   ^32Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,

   ^33Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,

   ^34Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the
   son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,

   ^35Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,

   ^36Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,

   ^37Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the
   son of Zeruiah,

   ^38Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,

   ^39Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.

    Chapter Samuel 24

   And again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he
   moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.

   ^2For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with
   him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to
   Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the
   people.

   ^3And Joab said unto the king, Now the Lord thy God add unto the
   people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of
   my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in
   this thing?

   ^4Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against
   the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went
   out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.

   ^5And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side
   of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward
   Jazer:

   ^6Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they
   came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,

   ^7And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the
   Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of
   Judah, even to Beersheba.

   ^8So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at
   the end of nine months and twenty days.

   ^9And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king:
   and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew
   the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.

   ^10And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people.
   And David said unto the Lord, I have sinned greatly in that I have
   done: and now, I beseech thee, O Lord, take away the iniquity of thy
   servant; for I have done very foolishly.

   ^11For when David was up in the morning, the word of the Lord came unto
   the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,

   ^12Go and say unto David, Thus saith the Lord, I offer thee three
   things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.

   ^13So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven
   years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three
   months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be
   three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I
   shall return to him that sent me.

   ^14And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now
   into the hand of the Lord; for his mercies are great: and let me not
   fall into the hand of man.

   ^15So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to
   the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to
   Beersheba seventy thousand men.

   ^16And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy
   it, the Lord repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that
   destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel
   of the Lord was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.

   ^17And David spake unto the Lord when he saw the angel that smote the
   people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but
   these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be
   against me, and against my father's house.

   ^18And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an
   altar unto the Lord in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.

   ^19And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the Lord
   commanded.

   ^20And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on
   toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on
   his face upon the ground.

   ^21And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant?
   And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar
   unto the Lord, that the plague may be stayed from the people.

   ^22And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up
   what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice,
   and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.

   ^23All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And
   Araunah said unto the king, The Lord thy God accept thee.

   ^24And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of
   thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my
   God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the
   threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.

   ^25And David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt
   offerings and peace offerings. So the Lord was intreated for the land,
   and the plague was stayed from Israel.

    Chapter Kings 1

   Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with
   clothes, but he gat no heat.

   ^2Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord
   the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her
   cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may
   get heat.

   ^3So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel,
   and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.

   ^4And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered
   to him: but the king knew her not.

   ^5Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be
   king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run
   before him.

   ^6And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast
   thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare
   him after Absalom.

   ^7And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the
   priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.

   ^8But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the
   prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to
   David, were not with Adonijah.

   ^9And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of
   Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's
   sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:

   ^10But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon
   his brother, he called not.

   ^11Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying,
   Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and
   David our lord knoweth it not?

   ^12Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that
   thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.

   ^13Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not
   thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly
   Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
   why then doth Adonijah reign?

   ^14Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come
   in after thee, and confirm thy words.

   ^15And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king
   was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.

   ^16And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king
   said, What wouldest thou?

   ^17And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the Lord thy God
   unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign
   after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.

   ^18And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou
   knowest it not:

   ^19And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and
   hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab
   the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.

   ^20And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee,
   that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord
   the king after him.

   ^21Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep
   with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.

   ^22And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also
   came in.

   ^23And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when
   he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with
   his face to the ground.

   ^24And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall
   reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?

   ^25For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and
   sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the
   captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat
   and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.

   ^26But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the
   son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.

   ^27Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it
   unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king
   after him?

   ^28Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came
   into the king's presence, and stood before the king.

   ^29And the king sware, and said, As the Lord liveth, that hath redeemed
   my soul out of all distress,

   ^30Even as I sware unto thee by the Lord God of Israel, saying,
   Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon
   my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.

   ^31Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence
   to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.

   ^32And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
   prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the
   king.

   ^33The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your
   lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring
   him down to Gihon:

   ^34And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there
   king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king
   Solomon.

   ^35Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my
   throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to
   be ruler over Israel and over Judah.

   ^36And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen:
   the Lord God of my lord the king say so too.

   ^37As the Lord hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with
   Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king
   David.

   ^38So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of
   Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and
   caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to
   Gihon.

   ^39And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and
   anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said,
   God save king Solomon.

   ^40And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with
   pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the
   sound of them.

   ^41And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they
   had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the
   trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an
   uproar?

   ^42And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the
   priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a
   valiant man, and bringest good tidings.

   ^43And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king
   David hath made Solomon king.

   ^44And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
   prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the
   Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:

   ^45And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king
   in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city
   rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.

   ^46And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.

   ^47And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David,
   saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his
   throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the
   bed.

   ^48And also thus said the king, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,
   which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even
   seeing it.

   ^49And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up,
   and went every man his way.

   ^50And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and
   caught hold on the horns of the altar.

   ^51And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king
   Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar,
   saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his
   servant with the sword.

   ^52And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall
   not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found
   in him, he shall die.

   ^53So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And
   he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him,
   Go to thine house.

    Chapter Kings 2

   Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged
   Solomon his son, saying,

   ^2I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew
   thyself a man;

   ^3And keep the charge of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep
   his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his
   testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest
   prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:

   ^4That the Lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me,
   saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in
   truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not
   fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.

   ^5Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,
   and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner
   the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and
   shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his
   girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his
   feet.

   ^6Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go
   down to the grave in peace.

   ^7But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let
   them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I
   fled because of Absalom thy brother.

   ^8And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite
   of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I
   went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to
   him by the Lord, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.

   ^9Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and
   knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou
   down to the grave with blood.

   ^10So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
   David.

   ^11And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven
   years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in
   Jerusalem.

   ^12Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his
   kingdom was established greatly.

   ^13And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of
   Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.

   ^14He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said,
   Say on.

   ^15And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all
   Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom
   is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the
   Lord.

   ^16And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto
   him, Say on.

   ^17And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will
   not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.

   ^18And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.

   ^19Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for
   Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her,
   and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's
   mother; and she sat on his right hand.

   ^20Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say
   me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will
   not say thee nay.

   ^21And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy
   brother to wife.

   ^22And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost
   thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom
   also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the
   priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.

   ^23Then king Solomon sware by the Lord, saying, God do so to me, and
   more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.

   ^24Now therefore, as the Lord liveth, which hath established me, and
   set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house,
   as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.

   ^25And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada;
   and he fell upon him that he died.

   ^26And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth,
   unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at
   this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord
   GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all
   wherein my father was afflicted.

   ^27So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the Lord; that
   he might fulfil the word of the Lord, which he spake concerning the
   house of Eli in Shiloh.

   ^28Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
   though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle
   of the Lord, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.

   ^29And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle
   of the Lord; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah
   the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.

   ^30And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said unto him,
   Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here.
   And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and
   thus he answered me.

   ^31And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him,
   and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab
   shed, from me, and from the house of my father.

   ^32And the Lord shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon
   two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the
   sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of
   Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether,
   captain of the host of Judah.

   ^33Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon
   the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and
   upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from
   the Lord.

   ^34So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew
   him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.

   ^35And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the
   host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.

   ^36And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build
   thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence
   any whither.

   ^37For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over
   the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely
   die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.

   ^38And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the
   king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem
   many days.

   ^39And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the
   servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath.
   And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.

   ^40And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to
   seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.

   ^41And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath,
   and was come again.

   ^42And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I
   not make thee to swear by the Lord, and protested unto thee, saying,
   Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any
   whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word
   that I have heard is good.

   ^43Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the Lord, and the
   commandment that I have charged thee with?

   ^44The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness
   which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father:
   therefore the Lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;

   ^45And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be
   established before the Lord for ever.

   ^46So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out,
   and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the
   hand of Solomon.

    Chapter Kings 3

   And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
   Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he
   had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the Lord,
   and the wall of Jerusalem round about.

   ^2Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house
   built unto the name of the Lord, until those days.

   ^3And Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of David his
   father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.

   ^4And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the
   great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon
   that altar.

   ^5In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God
   said, Ask what I shall give thee.

   ^6And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father
   great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in
   righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast
   kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit
   on his throne, as it is this day.

   ^7And now, O Lord my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of
   David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out
   or come in.

   ^8And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen,
   a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.

   ^9Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy
   people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to
   judge this thy so great a people?

   ^10And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.

   ^11And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast
   not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself,
   nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself
   understanding to discern judgment;

   ^12Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a
   wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee
   before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.

   ^13And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both
   riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like
   unto thee all thy days.

   ^14And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my
   commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy
   days.

   ^15And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to
   Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and
   offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a
   feast to all his servants.

   ^16Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and
   stood before him.

   ^17And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one
   house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.

   ^18And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that
   this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no
   stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.

   ^19And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.

   ^20And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while
   thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child
   in my bosom.

   ^21And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was
   dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not
   my son, which I did bear.

   ^22And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the
   dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the
   living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.

   ^23Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and
   thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead,
   and my son is the living.

   ^24And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before
   the king.

   ^25And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to
   the one, and half to the other.

   ^26Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for
   her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the
   living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be
   neither mine nor thine, but divide it.

   ^27Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in
   no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.

   ^28And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and
   they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him,
   to do judgment.

    Chapter Kings 4

   So king Solomon was king over all Israel.

   ^2And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the
   priest,

   ^3Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son
   of Ahilud, the recorder.

   ^4And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and
   Abiathar were the priests:

   ^5And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the
   son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:

   ^6And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was
   over the tribute.

   ^7And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided
   victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year
   made provision.

   ^8And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:

   ^9The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and
   Elonbethhanan:

   ^10The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the
   land of Hepher:

   ^11The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the
   daughter of Solomon to wife:

   ^12Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and
   all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to
   Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam:

   ^13The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of
   Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained
   the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with
   walls and brasen bars:

   ^14Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:

   ^15Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of
   Solomon to wife:

   ^16Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:

   ^17Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:

   ^18Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:

   ^19Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of
   Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the
   only officer which was in the land.

   ^20Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in
   multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.

   ^21And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land
   of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought
   presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.

   ^22And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine
   flour, and threescore measures of meal,

   ^23Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred
   sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.

   ^24For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from
   Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and
   he had peace on all sides round about him.

   ^25And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and
   under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of
   Solomon.

   ^26And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots,
   and twelve thousand horsemen.

   ^27And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all
   that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they
   lacked nothing.

   ^28Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they
   unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his
   charge.

   ^29And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and
   largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.

   ^30And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the
   east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.

   ^31For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman,
   and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all
   nations round about.

   ^32And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand
   and five.

   ^33And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even
   unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of
   beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.

   ^34And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all
   kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 5

   And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard
   that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram
   was ever a lover of David.

   ^2And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,

   ^3Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto
   the name of the Lord his God for the wars which were about him on every
   side, until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet.

   ^4But now the Lord my God hath given me rest on every side, so that
   there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.

   ^5And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the Lord my
   God, as the Lord spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I
   will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my
   name.

   ^6Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of
   Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will
   I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint:
   for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew
   timber like unto the Sidonians.

   ^7And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he
   rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the Lord this day, which hath
   given unto David a wise son over this great people.

   ^8And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which
   thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber
   of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.

   ^9My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I
   will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt
   appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt
   receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for
   my household.

   ^10So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his
   desire.

   ^11And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to
   his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to
   Hiram year by year.

   ^12And the Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was
   peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.

   ^13And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was
   thirty thousand men.

   ^14And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a
   month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was
   over the levy.

   ^15And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and
   fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;

   ^16Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the work,
   three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that
   wrought in the work.

   ^17And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly
   stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.

   ^18And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the
   stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 6

   And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the
   children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth
   year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the
   second month, that he began to build the house of the Lord.

   ^2And the house which king Solomon built for the Lord, the length
   thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits,
   and the height thereof thirty cubits.

   ^3And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the
   length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits
   was the breadth thereof before the house.

   ^4And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.

   ^5And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,
   against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of
   the oracle: and he made chambers round about:

   ^6The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six
   cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the
   wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams
   should not be fastened in the walls of the house.

   ^7And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready
   before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe
   nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.

   ^8The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house:
   and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out
   of the middle into the third.

   ^9So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with
   beams and boards of cedar.

   ^10And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high:
   and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.

   ^11And the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying,

   ^12Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk
   in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments
   to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake
   unto David thy father:

   ^13And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake
   my people Israel.

   ^14So Solomon built the house, and finished it.

   ^15And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar,
   both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: and he
   covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the
   house with planks of fir.

   ^16And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor
   and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within,
   even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.

   ^17And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.

   ^18And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open
   flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.

   ^19And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark
   of the covenant of the Lord.

   ^20And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and
   twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and
   he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of
   cedar.

   ^21So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a
   partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it
   with gold.

   ^22And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all
   the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with
   gold.

   ^23And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten
   cubits high.

   ^24And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the
   other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto
   the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.

   ^25And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one
   measure and one size.

   ^26The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the
   other cherub.

   ^27And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched
   forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched
   the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall;
   and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.

   ^28And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.

   ^29And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved
   figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and
   without.

   ^30And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
   without.

   ^31And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the
   lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.

   ^32The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them
   carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid
   them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm
   trees.

   ^33So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a
   fourth part of the wall.

   ^34And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door
   were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.

   ^35And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and
   covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.

   ^36And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a
   row of cedar beams.

   ^37In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the Lord laid,
   in the month Zif:

   ^38And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth
   month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and
   according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building
   it.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 7

   But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished
   all his house.

   ^2He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof
   was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the
   height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with
   cedar beams upon the pillars.

   ^3And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty
   five pillars, fifteen in a row.

   ^4And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in
   three ranks.

   ^5And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light
   was against light in three ranks.

   ^6And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits,
   and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them:
   and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.

   ^7Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the
   porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the
   floor to the other.

   ^8And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch,
   which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's
   daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.

   ^9All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed
   stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation
   unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.

   ^10And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones
   of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.

   ^11And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones,
   and cedars.

   ^12And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones,
   and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the
   Lord, and for the porch of the house.

   ^13And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.

   ^14He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a
   man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and
   understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to
   king Solomon, and wrought all his work.

   ^15For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece:
   and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.

   ^16And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of
   the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the
   height of the other chapiter was five cubits:

   ^17And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the
   chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one
   chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.

   ^18And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one
   network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with
   pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.

   ^19And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily
   work in the porch, four cubits.

   ^20And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above,
   over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates
   were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.

   ^21And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up
   the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the
   left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.

   ^22And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of
   the pillars finished.

   ^23And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other:
   it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of
   thirty cubits did compass it round about.

   ^24And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it,
   ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in
   two rows, when it was cast.

   ^25It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three
   looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three
   looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all
   their hinder parts were inward.

   ^26And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought
   like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two
   thousand baths.

   ^27And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one
   base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height
   of it.

   ^28And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and
   the borders were between the ledges:

   ^29And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen,
   and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath
   the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.

   ^30And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the
   four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were
   undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.

   ^31And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but
   the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an
   half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders,
   foursquare, not round.

   ^32And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the
   wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit
   and half a cubit.

   ^33And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel:
   their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes,
   were all molten.

   ^34And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base:
   and the undersetters were of the very base itself.

   ^35And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit
   high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders
   thereof were of the same.

   ^36For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof,
   he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion
   of every one, and additions round about.

   ^37After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one
   casting, one measure, and one size.

   ^38Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths:
   and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases
   one laver.

   ^39And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on
   the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the
   house eastward over against the south.

   ^40And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram
   made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the
   house of the Lord:

   ^41The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the
   top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of
   the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;

   ^42And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of
   pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters
   that were upon the pillars;

   ^43And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;

   ^44And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;

   ^45And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these
   vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the Lord,
   were of bright brass.

   ^46In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground
   between Succoth and Zarthan.

   ^47And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were
   exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.

   ^48And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of
   the Lord: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the
   shewbread was,

   ^49And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five
   on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and
   the tongs of gold,

   ^50And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and
   the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of
   the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house,
   to wit, of the temple.

   ^51So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of
   the Lord. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had
   dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put
   among the treasures of the house of the Lord.

    Chapter Kings 8

   Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the
   tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king
   Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant
   of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion.

   ^2And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at
   the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.

   ^3And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.

   ^4And they brought up the ark of the Lord, and the tabernacle of the
   congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle,
   even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.

   ^5And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were
   assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and
   oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.

   ^6And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto
   his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even
   under the wings of the cherubims.

   ^7For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the
   ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.

   ^8And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen
   out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen
   without: and there they are unto this day.

   ^9There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which
   Moses put there at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the
   children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.

   ^10And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
   place, that the cloud filled the house of the Lord,

   ^11So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the
   cloud: for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord.

   ^12Then spake Solomon, The Lord said that he would dwell in the thick
   darkness.

   ^13I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for
   thee to abide in for ever.

   ^14And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation
   of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)

   ^15And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which spake with his
   mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it,
   saying,

   ^16Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I
   chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that
   my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people
   Israel.

   ^17And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the
   name of the Lord God of Israel.

   ^18And the Lord said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine
   heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in
   thine heart.

   ^19Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall
   come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.

   ^20And the Lord hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen
   up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as
   the Lord promised, and have built an house for the name of the Lord God
   of Israel.

   ^21And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of
   the Lord, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of
   the land of Egypt.

   ^22And Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of
   all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward
   heaven:

   ^23And he said, Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in
   heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with
   thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:

   ^24Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst
   him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine
   hand, as it is this day.

   ^25Therefore now, Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my
   father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a
   man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children
   take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked
   before me.

   ^26And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified,
   which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.

   ^27But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and
   heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I
   have builded?

   ^28Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his
   supplication, O Lord my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer,
   which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:

   ^29That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even
   toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that
   thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward
   this place.

   ^30And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy
   people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in
   heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.

   ^31If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon
   him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this
   house:

   ^32Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning
   the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the
   righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.

   ^33When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because
   they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and
   confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this
   house:

   ^34Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel,
   and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their
   fathers.

   ^35When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have
   sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy
   name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:

   ^36Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and
   of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they
   should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy
   people for an inheritance.

   ^37If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting,
   mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them
   in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness
   there be;

   ^38What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all
   thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own
   heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:

   ^39Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do,
   and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest;
   (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of
   men;)

   ^40That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land
   which thou gavest unto our fathers.

   ^41Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel,
   but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;

   ^42(For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and
   of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this
   house;

   ^43Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that
   the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know
   thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know
   that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.

   ^44If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever
   thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the Lord toward the city
   which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy
   name:

   ^45Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and
   maintain their cause.

   ^46If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,)
   and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that
   they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;

   ^47Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were
   carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the
   land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and
   have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;

   ^48And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their
   soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and
   pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers,
   the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for
   thy name:

   ^49Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy
   dwelling place, and maintain their cause,

   ^50And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their
   transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give
   them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may
   have compassion on them:

   ^51For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest
   forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:

   ^52That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant,
   and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in
   all that they call for unto thee.

   ^53For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth,
   to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy
   servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.

   ^54And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this
   prayer and supplication unto the Lord, he arose from before the altar
   of the Lord, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to
   heaven.

   ^55And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud
   voice, saying,

   ^56Blessed be the Lord, that hath given rest unto his people Israel,
   according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of
   all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his
   servant.

   ^57The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not
   leave us, nor forsake us:

   ^58That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways,
   and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments,
   which he commanded our fathers.

   ^59And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before
   the Lord, be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night, that he maintain
   the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all
   times, as the matter shall require:

   ^60That all the people of the earth may know that the Lord is God, and
   that there is none else.

   ^61Let your heart therefore be perfect with the Lord our God, to walk
   in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.

   ^62And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the
   Lord.

   ^63And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered
   unto the Lord, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty
   thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated
   the house of the Lord.

   ^64The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was
   before the house of the Lord: for there he offered burnt offerings, and
   meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen
   altar that was before the Lord was too little to receive the burnt
   offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.

   ^65And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a
   great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of
   Egypt, before the Lord our God, seven days and seven days, even
   fourteen days.

   ^66On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the
   king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the
   goodness that the Lord had done for David his servant, and for Israel
   his people.

    Chapter Kings 9

   And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the
   house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which
   he was pleased to do,

   ^2That the Lord appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared
   unto him at Gibeon.

   ^3And the Lord said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy
   supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this
   house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine
   eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.

   ^4And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in
   integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I
   have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:

   ^5Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever,
   as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a
   man upon the throne of Israel.

   ^6But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children,
   and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set
   before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:

   ^7Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them;
   and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of
   my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:

   ^8And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall
   be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the Lord
   done thus unto this land, and to this house?

   ^9And they shall answer, Because they forsook the Lord their God, who
   brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken
   hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them:
   therefore hath the Lord brought upon them all this evil.

   ^10And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had
   built the two houses, the house of the Lord, and the king's house,

   ^11(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees
   and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then
   king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.

   ^12And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had
   given him; and they pleased him not.

   ^13And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my
   brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.

   ^14And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.

   ^15And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to
   build the house of the Lord, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall
   of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.

   ^16For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it
   with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given
   it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.

   ^17And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,

   ^18And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,

   ^19And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his
   chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired
   to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his
   dominion.

   ^20And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,
   Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of
   Israel,

   ^21Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the
   children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those
   did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.

   ^22But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they
   were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains,
   and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.

   ^23These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work,
   five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in
   the work.

   ^24But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her
   house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.

   ^25And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and
   peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the Lord, and he
   burnt incense upon the altar that was before the Lord. So he finished
   the house.

   ^26And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside
   Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.

   ^27And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge
   of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.

   ^28And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred
   and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 10

   And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the
   name of the Lord, she came to prove him with hard questions.

   ^2And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that
   bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was
   come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.

   ^3And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid
   from the king, which he told her not.

   ^4And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the
   house that he had built,

   ^5And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the
   attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and
   his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the Lord; there was no
   more spirit in her.

   ^6And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine
   own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.

   ^7Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had
   seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and
   prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.

   ^8Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand
   continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.

   ^9Blessed be the Lord thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on
   the throne of Israel: because the Lord loved Israel for ever, therefore
   made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.

   ^10And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of
   spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such
   abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king
   Solomon.

   ^11And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in
   from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.

   ^12And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the
   Lord, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers:
   there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.

   ^13And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,
   whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal
   bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her
   servants.

   ^14Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
   hundred threescore and six talents of gold,

   ^15Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the
   spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors
   of the country.

   ^16And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
   hundred shekels of gold went to one target.

   ^17And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of
   gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the
   forest of Lebanon.

   ^18Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with
   the best gold.

   ^19The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round
   behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat,
   and two lions stood beside the stays.

   ^20And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon
   the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.

   ^21And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the
   vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none
   were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.

   ^22For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram:
   once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and
   silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

   ^23So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and
   for wisdom.

   ^24And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God
   had put in his heart.

   ^25And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
   vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and
   mules, a rate year by year.

   ^26And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a
   thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom
   he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.

   ^27And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars
   made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for
   abundance.

   ^28And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the
   king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

   ^29And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels
   of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the
   kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them
   out by their means.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 11

   But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter
   of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and
   Hittites;

   ^2Of the nations concerning which the Lord said unto the children of
   Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto
   you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods:
   Solomon clave unto these in love.

   ^3And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
   concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.

   ^4For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away
   his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord
   his God, as was the heart of David his father.

   ^5For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and
   after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.

   ^6And Solomon did evil in the sight of the Lord, and went not fully
   after the Lord, as did David his father.

   ^7Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of
   Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the
   abomination of the children of Ammon.

   ^8And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense
   and sacrificed unto their gods.

   ^9And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned
   from the Lord God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,

   ^10And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go
   after other gods: but he kept not that which the Lord commanded.

   ^11Wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of
   thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have
   commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give
   it to thy servant.

   ^12Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's
   sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.

   ^13Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one
   tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake
   which I have chosen.

   ^14And the Lord stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the
   Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.

   ^15For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of
   the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male
   in Edom;

   ^16(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had
   cut off every male in Edom:)

   ^17That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants
   with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.

   ^18And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men
   with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of
   Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave
   him land.

   ^19And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he
   gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the
   queen.

   ^20And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes
   weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household
   among the sons of Pharaoh.

   ^21And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and
   that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let
   me depart, that I may go to mine own country.

   ^22Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that,
   behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered,
   Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.

   ^23And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah,
   which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:

   ^24And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when
   David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein,
   and reigned in Damascus.

   ^25And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside
   the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over
   Syria.

   ^26And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's
   servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted
   up his hand against the king.

   ^27And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king:
   Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his
   father.

   ^28And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing
   the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the
   charge of the house of Joseph.

   ^29And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of
   Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way;
   and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in
   the field:

   ^30And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in
   twelve pieces:

   ^31And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the
   Lord, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the
   hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:

   ^32(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for
   Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of
   Israel:)

   ^33Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth
   the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and
   Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my
   ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes
   and my judgments, as did David his father.

   ^34Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I
   will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's
   sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:

   ^35But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it
   unto thee, even ten tribes.

   ^36And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may
   have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen
   me to put my name there.

   ^37And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy
   soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.

   ^38And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee,
   and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my
   statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be
   with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will
   give Israel unto thee.

   ^39And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.

   ^40Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and
   fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the
   death of Solomon.

   ^41And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his
   wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?

   ^42And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was
   forty years.

   ^43And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
   David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 12

   And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to
   make him king.

   ^2And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in
   Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon,
   and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)

   ^3That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation
   of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,

   ^4Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the
   grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon
   us, lighter, and we will serve thee.

   ^5And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to
   me. And the people departed.

   ^6And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before
   Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that
   I may answer this people?

   ^7And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this
   people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good
   words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.

   ^8But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him,
   and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which
   stood before him:

   ^9And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this
   people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father
   did put upon us lighter?

   ^10And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him,
   saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee,
   saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto
   us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker
   than my father's loins.

   ^11And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add
   to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will
   chastise you with scorpions.

   ^12So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as
   the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.

   ^13And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's
   counsel that they gave him;

   ^14And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My
   father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father
   also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

   ^15Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was
   from the Lord, that he might perform his saying, which the Lord spake
   by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

   ^16So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the
   people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David?
   neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O
   Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto
   their tents.

   ^17But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of
   Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

   ^18Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all
   Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam
   made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.

   ^19So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

   ^20And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come
   again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made
   him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of
   David, but the tribe of Judah only.

   ^21And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house
   of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand
   chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel,
   to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.

   ^22But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,

   ^23Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all
   the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people,
   saying,

   ^24Thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your
   brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for
   this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the
   Lord, and returned to depart, according to the word of the Lord.

   ^25Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and
   went out from thence, and built Penuel.

   ^26And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the
   house of David:

   ^27If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the Lord at
   Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their
   lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go
   again to Rehoboam king of Judah.

   ^28Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and
   said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold
   thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

   ^29And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.

   ^30And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before
   the one, even unto Dan.

   ^31And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest
   of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.

   ^32And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth
   day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered
   upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that
   he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places
   which he had made.

   ^33So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the
   fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had
   devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of
   Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 13

   And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the
   Lord unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.

   ^2And he cried against the altar in the word of the Lord, and said, O
   altar, altar, thus saith the Lord; Behold, a child shall be born unto
   the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the
   priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones
   shall be burnt upon thee.

   ^3And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the
   Lord hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that
   are upon it shall be poured out.

   ^4And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man
   of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth
   his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which
   he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in
   again to him.

   ^5The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar,
   according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the
   Lord.

   ^6And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the
   face of the Lord thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored
   me again. And the man of God besought the Lord, and the king's hand was
   restored him again, and became as it was before.

   ^7And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh
   thyself, and I will give thee a reward.

   ^8And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half
   thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor
   drink water in this place:

   ^9For so was it charged me by the word of the Lord, saying, Eat no
   bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou
   camest.

   ^10So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to
   Bethel.

   ^11Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told
   him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the
   words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their
   father.

   ^12And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had
   seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.

   ^13And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him
   the ass: and he rode thereon,

   ^14And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak:
   and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah?
   And he said, I am.

   ^15Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.

   ^16And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:
   neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:

   ^17For it was said to me by the word of the Lord, Thou shalt eat no
   bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou
   camest.

   ^18He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel
   spake unto me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with thee
   into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied
   unto him.

   ^19So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank
   water.

   ^20And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the
   Lord came unto the prophet that brought him back:

   ^21And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus
   saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the Lord,
   and hast not kept the commandment which the Lord thy God commanded
   thee,

   ^22But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place,
   of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no
   water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.

   ^23And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had
   drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he
   had brought back.

   ^24And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and
   his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also
   stood by the carcase.

   ^25And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and
   the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city
   where the old prophet dwelt.

   ^26And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard
   thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the
   word of the Lord: therefore the Lord hath delivered him unto the lion,
   which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the Lord,
   which he spake unto him.

   ^27And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they
   saddled him.

   ^28And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and
   the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase,
   nor torn the ass.

   ^29And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it
   upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the
   city, to mourn and to bury him.

   ^30And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him,
   saying, Alas, my brother!

   ^31And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his
   sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the
   man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:

   ^32For the saying which he cried by the word of the Lord against the
   altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which
   are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.

   ^33After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made
   again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever
   would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high
   places.

   ^34And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it
   off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 14

   At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.

   ^2And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise
   thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get
   thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that
   I should be king over this people.

   ^3And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey,
   and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child.

   ^4And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came
   to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set
   by reason of his age.

   ^5And the Lord said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to
   ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt
   thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall
   feign herself to be another woman.

   ^6And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came
   in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why
   feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy
   tidings.

   ^7Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Forasmuch as I
   exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people
   Israel,

   ^8And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee:
   and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my
   commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only
   which was right in mine eyes;

   ^9But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast
   gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to
   anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:

   ^10Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and
   will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him
   that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of
   the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.

   ^11Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him
   that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the Lord
   hath spoken it.

   ^12Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet
   enter into the city, the child shall die.

   ^13And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of
   Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some
   good thing toward the Lord God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.

   ^14Moreover the Lord shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall
   cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.

   ^15For the Lord shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water,
   and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to
   their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they
   have made their groves, provoking the Lord to anger.

   ^16And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did
   sin, and who made Israel to sin.

   ^17And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and
   when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;

   ^18And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to
   the word of the Lord, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah
   the prophet.

   ^19And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he
   reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
   kings of Israel.

   ^20And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and
   he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.

   ^21And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty
   and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen
   years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord did choose out of all the
   tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was
   Naamah an Ammonitess.

   ^22And Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they provoked him
   to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that
   their fathers had done.

   ^23For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on
   every high hill, and under every green tree.

   ^24And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to
   all the abominations of the nations which the Lord cast out before the
   children of Israel.

   ^25And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak
   king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:

   ^26And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the
   treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away
   all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.

   ^27And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed
   them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of
   the king's house.

   ^28And it was so, when the king went into the house of the Lord, that
   the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.

   ^29Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they
   not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

   ^30And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.

   ^31And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
   in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
   And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 15

   Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned
   Abijam over Judah.

   ^2Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
   Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

   ^3And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before
   him: and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as the heart
   of David his father.

   ^4Nevertheless for David's sake did the Lord his God give him a lamp in
   Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:

   ^5Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and
   turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of
   his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.

   ^6And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his
   life.

   ^7Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not
   written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there
   was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.

   ^8And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of
   David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.

   ^9And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over
   Judah.

   ^10And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's
   name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

   ^11And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, as did
   David his father.

   ^12And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the
   idols that his fathers had made.

   ^13And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen,
   because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol,
   and burnt it by the brook Kidron.

   ^14But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was
   perfect with the Lord all his days.

   ^15And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the
   things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the Lord, silver,
   and gold, and vessels.

   ^16And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their
   days.

   ^17And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah,
   that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.

   ^18Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the
   treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's
   house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa
   sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of
   Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,

   ^19There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy
   father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold;
   come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may
   depart from me.

   ^20So Ben- hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the
   hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and
   Dan, and Abel-Bethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of
   Naphtali.

   ^21And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off
   building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.

   ^22Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was
   exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber
   thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them
   Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.

   ^23The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he
   did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of
   the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his
   old age he was diseased in his feet.

   ^24And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in
   the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his
   stead.

   ^25And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the
   second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.

   ^26And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of
   his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.

   ^27And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired
   against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the
   Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.

   ^28Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and
   reigned in his stead.

   ^29And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of
   Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had
   destroyed him, according unto the saying of the Lord, which he spake by
   his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:

   ^30Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made
   Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the Lord God of
   Israel to anger.

   ^31Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not
   written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

   ^32And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their
   days.

   ^33In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of
   Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.

   ^34And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of
   Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 16

   Then the word of the Lord came to Jehu the son of Hanani against
   Baasha, saying,

   ^2Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince
   over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and
   hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their
   sins;

   ^3Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity
   of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the
   son of Nebat.

   ^4Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that
   dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.

   ^5Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might,
   are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
   Israel?

   ^6So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah
   his son reigned in his stead.

   ^7And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the
   word of the Lord against Baasha, and against his house, even for all
   the evil that he did in the sight of the Lord, in provoking him to
   anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam;
   and because he killed him.

   ^8In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son
   of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.

   ^9And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
   against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house
   of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.

   ^10And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and
   seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.

   ^11And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on
   his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one
   that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his
   friends.

   ^12Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the
   word of the Lord, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,

   ^13For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which
   they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the
   Lord God of Israel to anger with their vanities.

   ^14Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not
   written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

   ^15In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign
   seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon,
   which belonged to the Philistines.

   ^16And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired,
   and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the
   captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.

   ^17And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they
   besieged Tirzah.

   ^18And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he
   went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house
   over him with fire, and died,

   ^19For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the Lord,
   in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make
   Israel to sin.

   ^20Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought,
   are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
   Israel?

   ^21Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the
   people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half
   followed Omri.

   ^22But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that
   followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.

   ^23In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to
   reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.

   ^24And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver,
   and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built,
   after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.

   ^25But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the Lord, and did worse than
   all that were before him.

   ^26For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in
   his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the Lord God of
   Israel to anger with their vanities.

   ^27Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he
   shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
   of Israel?

   ^28So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab
   his son reigned in his stead.

   ^29And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab
   the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned
   over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.

   ^30And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above all
   that were before him.

   ^31And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk
   in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel
   the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served
   Baal, and worshipped him.

   ^32And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he
   had built in Samaria.

   ^33And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of
   Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.

   ^34In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the
   foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates
   thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the Lord,
   which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.

    Chapter Kings 17

   And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said
   unto Ahab, As the Lord God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there
   shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.

   ^2And the word of the Lord came unto him, saying,

   ^3Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook
   Cherith, that is before Jordan.

   ^4And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have
   commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

   ^5So he went and did according unto the word of the Lord: for he went
   and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.

   ^6And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread
   and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.

   ^7And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because
   there had been no rain in the land.

   ^8And the word of the Lord came unto him, saying,

   ^9Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell
   there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.

   ^10So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of
   the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he
   called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a
   vessel, that I may drink.

   ^11And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring
   me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.

   ^12And she said, As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an
   handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold,
   I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my
   son, that we may eat it, and die.

   ^13And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but
   make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, and after
   make for thee and for thy son.

   ^14For thus saith the Lord God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not
   waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the Lord
   sendeth rain upon the earth.

   ^15And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and
   he, and her house, did eat many days.

   ^16And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil
   fail, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah.

   ^17And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman,
   the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore,
   that there was no breath left in him.

   ^18And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of
   God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay
   my son?

   ^19And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her
   bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him
   upon his own bed.

   ^20And he cried unto the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, hast thou also
   brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?

   ^21And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto
   the Lord, and said, O Lord my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul
   come into him again.

   ^22And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child
   came into him again, and he revived.

   ^23And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber
   into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said,
   See, thy son liveth.

   ^24And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man
   of God, and that the word of the Lord in thy mouth is truth.

    Chapter Kings 18

   And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the Lord came to
   Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I
   will send rain upon the earth.

   ^2And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore
   famine in Samaria.

   ^3And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now
   Obadiah feared the Lord greatly:

   ^4For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord, that
   Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and
   fed them with bread and water.)

   ^5And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of
   water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the
   horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.

   ^6So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab
   went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.

   ^7And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew
   him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?

   ^8And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.

   ^9And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy
   servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?

   ^10As the Lord thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither
   my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not
   there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee
   not.

   ^11And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.

   ^12And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the
   Spirit of the Lord shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I
   come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I
   thy servant fear the Lord from my youth.

   ^13Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of
   the Lord, how I hid an hundred men of the Lord'S prophets by fifty in a
   cave, and fed them with bread and water?

   ^14And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and
   he shall slay me.

   ^15And Elijah said, As the Lord of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I
   will surely shew myself unto him to day.

   ^16So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet
   Elijah.

   ^17And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him,
   Art thou he that troubleth Israel?

   ^18And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy
   father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the Lord,
   and thou hast followed Baalim.

   ^19Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel,
   and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of
   the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.

   ^20So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the
   prophets together unto mount Carmel.

   ^21And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye
   between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then
   follow him. And the people answered him not a word.

   ^22Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet
   of the Lord; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.

   ^23Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one
   bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and
   put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on
   wood, and put no fire under:

   ^24And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of
   the Lord: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all
   the people answered and said, It is well spoken.

   ^25And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock
   for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the
   name of your gods, but put no fire under.

   ^26And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it,
   and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O
   Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they
   leaped upon the altar which was made.

   ^27And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry
   aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he
   is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.

   ^28And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with
   knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.

   ^29And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until
   the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was
   neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.

   ^30And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the
   people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that
   was broken down.

   ^31And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes
   of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the Lord came, saying,
   Israel shall be thy name:

   ^32And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord: and
   he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two
   measures of seed.

   ^33And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and
   laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour
   it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.

   ^34And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time.
   And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.

   ^35And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench
   also with water.

   ^36And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening
   sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, Lord God of
   Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art
   God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all
   these things at thy word.

   ^37Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art
   the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.

   ^38Then the fire of the Lord fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice,
   and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water
   that was in the trench.

   ^39And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they
   said, The Lord, he is the God; the Lord, he is the God.

   ^40And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of
   them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the
   brook Kishon, and slew them there.

   ^41And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is
   a sound of abundance of rain.

   ^42So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top
   of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face
   between his knees,

   ^43And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went
   up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven
   times.

   ^44And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there
   ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said,
   Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the
   rain stop thee not.

   ^45And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black
   with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and
   went to Jezreel.

   ^46And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins,
   and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 19

   And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had
   slain all the prophets with the sword.

   ^2Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do
   to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them
   by to morrow about this time.

   ^3And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to
   Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.

   ^4But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and
   sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he
   might die; and said, It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life; for
   I am not better than my fathers.

   ^5And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel
   touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.

   ^6And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and
   a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him
   down again.

   ^7And the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and touched
   him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for
   thee.

   ^8And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that
   meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.

   ^9And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the
   word of the Lord came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou
   here, Elijah?

   ^10And he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: for
   the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine
   altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am
   left; and they seek my life, to take it away.

   ^11And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord.
   And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the
   mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord
   was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was
   not in the earthquake:

   ^12And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire:
   and after the fire a still small voice.

   ^13And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his
   mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And,
   behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here,
   Elijah?

   ^14And he said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts:
   because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down
   thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I
   only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.

   ^15And the Lord said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness
   of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:

   ^16And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel:
   and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be
   prophet in thy room.

   ^17And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of
   Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu
   shall Elisha slay.

   ^18Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which
   have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.

   ^19So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was
   plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth:
   and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.

   ^20And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray
   thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he
   said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?

   ^21And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew
   them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave
   unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after
   Elijah, and ministered unto him.

    Chapter Kings 20

   And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and
   there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and
   he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.

   ^2And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said
   unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,

   ^3Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children,
   even the goodliest, are mine.

   ^4And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according
   to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.

   ^5And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad,
   saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me
   thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;

   ^6Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and
   they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it
   shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it
   in their hand, and take it away.

   ^7Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said,
   Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent
   unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for
   my gold; and I denied him not.

   ^8And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto
   him, nor consent.

   ^9Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the
   king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will
   do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and
   brought him word again.

   ^10And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and
   more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all
   the people that follow me.

   ^11And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that
   girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.

   ^12And it came to pass, when Benhadad heard this message, as he was
   drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his
   servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array
   against the city.

   ^13And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying,
   Thus saith the Lord, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I
   will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am
   the Lord.

   ^14And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the Lord, Even by
   the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall
   order the battle? And he answered, Thou.

   ^15Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and
   they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all
   the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.

   ^16And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk
   in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that
   helped him.

   ^17And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first;
   and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come
   out of Samaria.

   ^18And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or
   whether they be come out for war, take them alive.

   ^19So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the
   city, and the army which followed them.

   ^20And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel
   pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with
   the horsemen.

   ^21And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots,
   and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.

   ^22And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go,
   strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the
   return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.

   ^23And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are
   gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us
   fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than
   they.

   ^24And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place,
   and put captains in their rooms:

   ^25And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse
   for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in
   the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened
   unto their voice, and did so.

   ^26And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad
   numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.

   ^27And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and
   went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like
   two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.

   ^28And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and
   said, Thus saith the Lord, Because the Syrians have said, The Lord is
   God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I
   deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know
   that I am the Lord.

   ^29And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it
   was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of
   Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.

   ^30But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell
   upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad
   fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.

   ^31And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the
   kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee,
   put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the
   king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.

   ^32So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their
   heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad
   saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my
   brother.

   ^33Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from
   him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Benhadad.
   Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he
   caused him to come up into the chariot.

   ^34And Benhadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from
   thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in
   Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send
   thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent
   him away.

   ^35And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his
   neighbour in the word of the Lord, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man
   refused to smite him.

   ^36Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the
   Lord, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay
   thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and
   slew him.

   ^37Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the
   man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.

   ^38So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and
   disguised himself with ashes upon his face.

   ^39And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy
   servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man
   turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by
   any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else
   thou shalt pay a talent of silver.

   ^40And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the
   king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast
   decided it.

   ^41And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king
   of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.

   ^42And he said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast let go
   out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore
   thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.

   ^43And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and
   came to Samaria.

    Chapter Kings 21

   And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had
   a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of
   Samaria.

   ^2And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may
   have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I
   will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to
   thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.

   ^3And Naboth said to Ahab, The Lord forbid it me, that I should give
   the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.

   ^4And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word
   which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will
   not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon
   his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.

   ^5But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy
   spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?

   ^6And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and
   said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please
   thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will
   not give thee my vineyard.

   ^7And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom
   of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will
   give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.

   ^8So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal,
   and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his
   city, dwelling with Naboth.

   ^9And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth
   on high among the people:

   ^10And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against
   him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him
   out, and stone him, that he may die.

   ^11And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the
   inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it
   was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.

   ^12They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.

   ^13And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him:
   and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in
   the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the
   king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with
   stones, that he died.

   ^14Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.

   ^15And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and
   was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the
   vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for
   money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.

   ^16And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab
   rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take
   possession of it.

   ^17And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

   ^18Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria:
   behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to
   possess it.

   ^19And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Hast
   thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him,
   saying, Thus saith the Lord, In the place where dogs licked the blood
   of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.

   ^20And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he
   answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work
   evil in the sight of the Lord.

   ^21Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy
   posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the
   wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,

   ^22And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of
   Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the
   provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel
   to sin.

   ^23And of Jezebel also spake the Lord, saying, The dogs shall eat
   Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.

   ^24Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that
   dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.

   ^25But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work
   wickedness in the sight of the Lord, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.

   ^26And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all
   things as did the Amorites, whom the Lord cast out before the children
   of Israel.

   ^27And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his
   clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in
   sackcloth, and went softly.

   ^28And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

   ^29Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth
   himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his
   son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.

    Chapter Kings 22

   And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.

   ^2And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of
   Judah came down to the king of Israel.

   ^3And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in
   Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the
   king of Syria?

   ^4And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to
   Ramoth- gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as
   thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.

   ^5And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee,
   at the word of the Lord to day.

   ^6Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four
   hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to
   battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall
   deliver it into the hand of the king.

   ^7And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord
   besides, that we might enquire of him?

   ^8And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man,
   Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the Lord: but I
   hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And
   Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.

   ^9Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither
   Micaiah the son of Imlah.

   ^10And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on
   his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance
   of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.

   ^11And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he
   said, Thus saith the Lord, With these shalt thou push the Syrians,
   until thou have consumed them.

   ^12And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead,
   and prosper: for the Lord shall deliver it into the king's hand.

   ^13And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him,
   saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the
   king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one
   of them, and speak that which is good.

   ^14And Micaiah said, As the Lord liveth, what the Lord saith unto me,
   that will I speak.

   ^15So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall
   we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he
   answered him, Go, and prosper: for the Lord shall deliver it into the
   hand of the king.

   ^16And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that
   thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord?

   ^17And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep
   that have not a shepherd: and the Lord said, These have no master: let
   them return every man to his house in peace.

   ^18And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee
   that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?

   ^19And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord: I saw the
   Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him
   on his right hand and on his left.

   ^20And the Lord said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and
   fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on
   that manner.

   ^21And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said,
   I will persuade him.

   ^22And the Lord said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth,
   and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he
   said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.

   ^23Now therefore, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth
   of all these thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil concerning
   thee.

   ^24But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on
   the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to
   speak unto thee?

   ^25And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou
   shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

   ^26And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto
   Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;

   ^27And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and
   feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I
   come in peace.

   ^28And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the Lord hath not
   spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.

   ^29So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to
   Ramothgilead.

   ^30And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
   myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the
   king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.

   ^31But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had
   rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great,
   save only with the king of Israel.

   ^32And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
   Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they
   turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.

   ^33And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived
   that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing
   him.

   ^34And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of
   Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the
   driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host;
   for I am wounded.

   ^35And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his
   chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of
   the wound into the midst of the chariot.

   ^36And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going
   down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his
   own country.

   ^37So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the
   king in Samaria.

   ^38And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs
   licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the
   word of the Lord which he spake.

   ^39Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory
   house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not
   written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

   ^40So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his
   stead.

   ^41And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the
   fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.

   ^42Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign;
   and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
   name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.

   ^43And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside
   from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord:
   nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people
   offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.

   ^44And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.

   ^45Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he
   shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the
   chronicles of the kings of Judah?

   ^46And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his
   father Asa, he took out of the land.

   ^47There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.

   ^48Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but
   they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.

   ^49Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants
   go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.

   ^50And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
   fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in
   his stead.

   ^51Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the
   seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years
   over Israel.

   ^52And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of
   his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam
   the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:

   ^53For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the
   Lord God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.

    Chapter Kings 1

   Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.

   ^2And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was
   in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them,
   Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of
   this disease.

   ^3But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up
   to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it
   not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of
   Baalzebub the god of Ekron?

   ^4Now therefore thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not come down from that
   bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah
   departed.

   ^5And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why
   are ye now turned back?

   ^6And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto
   us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus
   saith the Lord, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that
   thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou
   shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt
   surely die.

   ^7And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up to
   meet you, and told you these words?

   ^8And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of
   leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.

   ^9Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he
   went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake
   unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.

   ^10And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man
   of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy
   fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his
   fifty.

   ^11Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty.
   And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king
   said, Come down quickly.

   ^12And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let
   fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the
   fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.

   ^13And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And
   the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees
   before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I
   pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be
   precious in thy sight.

   ^14Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two
   captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my
   life now be precious in thy sight.

   ^15And the angel of the Lord said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not
   afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.

   ^16And he said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou hast
   sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not
   because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore
   thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but
   shalt surely die.

   ^17So he died according to the word of the Lord which Elijah had
   spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram
   the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.

   ^18Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not
   written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

    Chapter Kings 2

   And it came to pass, when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by
   a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.

   ^2And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the Lord
   hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the Lord liveth,
   and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to
   Bethel.

   ^3And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to
   Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away
   thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye
   your peace.

   ^4And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the
   Lord hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the Lord liveth, and as
   thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.

   ^5And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and
   said unto him, Knowest thou that the Lord will take away thy master
   from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your
   peace.

   ^6And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the Lord hath
   sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy soul
   liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.

   ^7And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view
   afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.

   ^8And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the
   waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went
   over on dry ground.

   ^9And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto
   Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee.
   And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be
   upon me.

   ^10And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou see
   me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it
   shall not be so.

   ^11And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that,
   behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and
   parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into
   heaven.

   ^12And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot
   of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he
   took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.

   ^13He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went
   back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;

   ^14And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the
   waters, and said, Where is the Lord God of Elijah? and when he also had
   smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went
   over.

   ^15And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw
   him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came
   to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.

   ^16And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty
   strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest
   peradventure the Spirit of the Lord hath taken him up, and cast him
   upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not
   send.

   ^17And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They
   sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him
   not.

   ^18And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he
   said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?

   ^19And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the
   situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is
   naught, and the ground barren.

   ^20And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they
   brought it to him.

   ^21And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt
   in there, and said, Thus saith the Lord, I have healed these waters;
   there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.

   ^22So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of
   Elisha which he spake.

   ^23And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by
   the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked
   him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.

   ^24And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name
   of the Lord. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and
   tare forty and two children of them.

   ^25And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned
   to Samaria.

    Chapter Kings 3

   Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the
   eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.

   ^2And he wrought evil in the sight of the Lord; but not like his
   father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his
   father had made.

   ^3Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
   which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.

   ^4And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king
   of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with
   the wool.

   ^5But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab
   rebelled against the king of Israel.

   ^6And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all
   Israel.

   ^7And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The
   king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against
   Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people
   as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.

   ^8And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way
   through the wilderness of Edom.

   ^9So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of
   Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was
   no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.

   ^10And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the Lord hath called these
   three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!

   ^11But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that
   we may enquire of the Lord by him? And one of the king of Israel's
   servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which
   poured water on the hands of Elijah.

   ^12And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the Lord is with him. So the king
   of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.

   ^13And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with
   thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of
   thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the Lord
   hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand
   of Moab.

   ^14And Elisha said, As the Lord of hosts liveth, before whom I stand,
   surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king
   of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.

   ^15But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel
   played, that the hand of the Lord came upon him.

   ^16And he said, Thus saith the Lord, Make this valley full of ditches.

   ^17For thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see
   rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink,
   both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.

   ^18And this is but a light thing in the sight of the Lord: he will
   deliver the Moabites also into your hand.

   ^19And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and
   shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every
   good piece of land with stones.

   ^20And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was
   offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the
   country was filled with water.

   ^21And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight
   against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and
   upward, and stood in the border.

   ^22And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the
   water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as
   blood:

   ^23And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they
   have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.

   ^24And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and
   smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went
   forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.

   ^25And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast
   every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of
   water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the
   stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.

   ^26And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him,
   he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through
   even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.

   ^27Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead,
   and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great
   indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to
   their own land.

    Chapter Kings 4

   Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the
   prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou
   knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord: and the creditor is come to
   take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.

   ^2And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what
   hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing
   in the house, save a pot of oil.

   ^3Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours,
   even empty vessels; borrow not a few.

   ^4And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and
   upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou
   shalt set aside that which is full.

   ^5So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons,
   who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.

   ^6And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto
   her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a
   vessel more. And the oil stayed.

   ^7Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil,
   and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.

   ^8And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great
   woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft
   as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.

   ^9And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an
   holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.

   ^10Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us
   set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick:
   and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.

   ^11And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the
   chamber, and lay there.

   ^12And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he
   had called her, she stood before him.

   ^13And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been
   careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee?
   wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host?
   And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.

   ^14And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered,
   Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.

   ^15And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the
   door.

   ^16And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou
   shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do
   not lie unto thine handmaid.

   ^17And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha
   had said unto her, according to the time of life.

   ^18And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to
   his father to the reapers.

   ^19And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad,
   Carry him to his mother.

   ^20And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on
   her knees till noon, and then died.

   ^21And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut
   the door upon him, and went out.

   ^22And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one
   of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of
   God, and come again.

   ^23And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither new
   moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.

   ^24Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go
   forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.

   ^25So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it
   came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to
   Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:

   ^26Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with
   thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she
   answered, It is well.

   ^27And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by
   the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God
   said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the Lord
   hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.

   ^28Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not
   deceive me?

   ^29Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in
   thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and
   if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the
   face of the child.

   ^30And the mother of the child said, As the Lord liveth, and as thy
   soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.

   ^31And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face
   of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he
   went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.

   ^32And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead,
   and laid upon his bed.

   ^33He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed
   unto the Lord.

   ^34And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his
   mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he
   stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed
   warm.

   ^35Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up,
   and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and
   the child opened his eyes.

   ^36And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called
   her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.

   ^37Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the
   ground, and took up her son, and went out.

   ^38And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land;
   and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto
   his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of
   the prophets.

   ^39And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild
   vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred
   them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.

   ^40So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they
   were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man
   of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.

   ^41But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he
   said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm
   in the pot.

   ^42And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God
   bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of
   corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they
   may eat.

   ^43And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred
   men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith
   the Lord, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.

   ^44So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof,
   according to the word of the Lord.

    Chapter Kings 5

   Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man
   with his master, and honourable, because by him the Lord had given
   deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was
   a leper.

   ^2And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away
   captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on
   Naaman's wife.

   ^3And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the
   prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.

   ^4And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the
   maid that is of the land of Israel.

   ^5And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto
   the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of
   silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.

   ^6And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when
   this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my
   servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.

   ^7And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter,
   that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make
   alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy?
   wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel
   against me.

   ^8And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of
   Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying,
   Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he
   shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.

   ^9So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the
   door of the house of Elisha.

   ^10And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan
   seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be
   clean.

   ^11But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He
   will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord
   his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.

   ^12Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the
   waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned
   and went away in a rage.

   ^13And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father,
   if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have
   done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be
   clean?

   ^14Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan,
   according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again
   like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.

   ^15And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came,
   and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no
   God in earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a
   blessing of thy servant.

   ^16But he said, As the Lord liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive
   none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.

   ^17And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy
   servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth
   offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto
   the Lord.

   ^18In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth
   into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand,
   and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the
   house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing.

   ^19And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little
   way.

   ^20But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my
   master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands
   that which he brought: but, as the Lord liveth, I will run after him,
   and take somewhat of him.

   ^21So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running
   after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is
   all well?

   ^22And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold,
   even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the
   sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and
   two changes of garments.

   ^23And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and
   bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments,
   and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.

   ^24And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and
   bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed.

   ^25But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto
   him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no
   whither.

   ^26And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man
   turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive
   money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and
   sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?

   ^27The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy
   seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as
   snow.

    Chapter Kings 6

   And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place
   where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.

   ^2Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a
   beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he
   answered, Go ye.

   ^3And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And
   he answered, I will go.

   ^4So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down
   wood.

   ^5But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and
   he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.

   ^6And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place.
   And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.

   ^7Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and
   took it.

   ^8Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with
   his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.

   ^9And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that
   thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.

   ^10And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told
   him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.

   ^11Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this
   thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew
   me which of us is for the king of Israel?

   ^12And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the
   prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that
   thou speakest in thy bedchamber.

   ^13And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him.
   And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.

   ^14Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host:
   and they came by night, and compassed the city about.

   ^15And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone
   forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and
   chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we
   do?

   ^16And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than
   they that be with them.

   ^17And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that
   he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw:
   and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round
   about Elisha.

   ^18And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the Lord, and
   said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them
   with blindness according to the word of Elisha.

   ^19And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the
   city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he
   led them to Samaria.

   ^20And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha
   said, Lord, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the Lord
   opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of
   Samaria.

   ^21And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My
   father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?

   ^22And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite
   those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set
   bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to
   their master.

   ^23And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten
   and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the
   bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.

   ^24And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered
   all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.

   ^25And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged
   it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and
   the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver.

   ^26And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried
   a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.

   ^27And he said, If the Lord do not help thee, whence shall I help thee?
   out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?

   ^28And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This
   woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we
   will eat my son to morrow.

   ^29So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the
   next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.

   ^30And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman,
   that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the
   people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.

   ^31Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha
   the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.

   ^32But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the
   king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he
   said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take
   away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and
   hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind
   him?

   ^33And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down
   unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the Lord; what should I
   wait for the Lord any longer?
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 7

   Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord, To
   morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a
   shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of
   Samaria.

   ^2Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God,
   and said, Behold, if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this
   thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but
   shalt not eat thereof.

   ^3And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and
   they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?

   ^4If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the
   city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also.
   Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if
   they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but
   die.

   ^5And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians:
   and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria,
   behold, there was no man there.

   ^6For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of
   chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and
   they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us
   the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon
   us.

   ^7Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents,
   and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled
   for their life.

   ^8And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they
   went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver,
   and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered
   into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.

   ^9Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of
   good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning
   light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may
   go and tell the king's household.

   ^10So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told
   them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there
   was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses
   tied, and the tents as they were.

   ^11And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house
   within.

   ^12And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will
   now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be
   hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in
   the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them
   alive, and get into the city.

   ^13And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray
   thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city,
   (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it:
   behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites
   that are consumed:) and let us send and see.

   ^14They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the
   host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.

   ^15And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full
   of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their
   haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.

   ^16And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a
   measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley
   for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord.

   ^17And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the
   charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he
   died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to
   him.

   ^18And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king,
   saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine
   flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of
   Samaria:

   ^19And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the
   Lord should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said,
   Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.

   ^20And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the
   gate, and he died.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 8

   Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life,
   saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever
   thou canst sojourn: for the Lord hath called for a famine; and it shall
   also come upon the land seven years.

   ^2And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and
   she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the
   Philistines seven years.

   ^3And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned
   out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the
   king for her house and for her land.

   ^4And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God,
   saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath
   done.

   ^5And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a
   dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored
   to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi
   said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom
   Elisha restored to life.

   ^6And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king
   appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was
   hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the
   land, even until now.

   ^7And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick;
   and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.

   ^8And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go,
   meet the man of God, and enquire of the Lord by him, saying, Shall I
   recover of this disease?

   ^9So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of
   every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood
   before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to
   thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?

   ^10And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly
   recover: howbeit the Lord hath shewed me that he shall surely die.

   ^11And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and
   the man of God wept.

   ^12And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I
   know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their
   strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay
   with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women
   with child.

   ^13And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do
   this great thing? And Elisha answered, The Lord hath shewed me that
   thou shalt be king over Syria.

   ^14So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him,
   What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou
   shouldest surely recover.

   ^15And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and
   dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and
   Hazael reigned in his stead.

   ^16And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel,
   Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat
   king of Judah began to reign.

   ^17Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he
   reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

   ^18And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of
   Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the
   sight of the Lord.

   ^19Yet the Lord would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake,
   as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his children.

   ^20In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a
   king over themselves.

   ^21So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he
   rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and
   the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.

   ^22Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then
   Libnah revolted at the same time.

   ^23And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not
   written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

   ^24And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in
   the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.

   ^25In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did
   Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.

   ^26Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he
   reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah, the
   daughter of Omri king of Israel.

   ^27And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the
   sight of the Lord, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law
   of the house of Ahab.

   ^28And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael
   king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.

   ^29And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which
   the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king
   of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see
   Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.

    Chapter Kings 9

   And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and
   said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine
   hand, and go to Ramothgilead:

   ^2And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of
   Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from
   among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;

   ^3Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus
   saith the Lord, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the
   door, and flee, and tarry not.

   ^4So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to
   Ramothgilead.

   ^5And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and
   he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which
   of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.

   ^6And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his
   head, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I have
   anointed thee king over the people of the Lord, even over Israel.

   ^7And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge
   the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the
   servants of the Lord, at the hand of Jezebel.

   ^8For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from
   Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and
   left in Israel:

   ^9And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son
   of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:

   ^10And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there
   shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.

   ^11Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto
   him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said
   unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.

   ^12And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus
   spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the Lord, I have anointed thee king
   over Israel.

   ^13Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under
   him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is
   king.

   ^14So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against
   Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of
   Hazael king of Syria.

   ^15But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
   which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of
   Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor
   escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.

   ^16So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there.
   And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.

   ^17And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the
   company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said,
   Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?

   ^18So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the
   king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn
   thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to
   them, but he cometh not again.

   ^19Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and
   said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast
   thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.

   ^20And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh
   not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of
   Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.

   ^21And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And
   Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his
   chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of
   Naboth the Jezreelite.

   ^22And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace,
   Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy
   mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?

   ^23And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is
   treachery, O Ahaziah.

   ^24And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram
   between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down
   in his chariot.

   ^25Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the
   portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that,
   when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the Lord laid this
   burden upon him;

   ^26Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of
   his sons, saith the Lord; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith
   the Lord. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground,
   according to the word of the Lord.

   ^27But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of
   the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also
   in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by
   Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.

   ^28And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried
   him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.

   ^29And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to
   reign over Judah.

   ^30And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she
   painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.

   ^31And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who
   slew his master?

   ^32And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my
   side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.

   ^33And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her
   blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her
   under foot.

   ^34And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now
   this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.

   ^35And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the
   skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.

   ^36Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the
   word of the Lord, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite,
   saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:

   ^37And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the
   field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is
   Jezebel.

    Chapter Kings 10

   And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent
   to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that
   brought up Ahab's children, saying,

   ^2Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons
   are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city
   also, and armour;

   ^3Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set him
   on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house.

   ^4But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood
   not before him: how then shall we stand?

   ^5And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the
   elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying,
   We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will
   not make any king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes.

   ^6Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be
   mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the
   men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this
   time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great
   men of the city, which brought them up.

   ^7And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the
   king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets,
   and sent him them to Jezreel.

   ^8And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought
   the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at
   the entering in of the gate until the morning.

   ^9And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and
   said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my
   master, and slew him: but who slew all these?

   ^10Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of
   the Lord, which the Lord spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the
   Lord hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.

   ^11So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and
   all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left
   him none remaining.

   ^12And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the
   shearing house in the way,

   ^13Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who
   are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go
   down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.

   ^14And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew
   them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither
   left he any of them.

   ^15And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of
   Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is
   thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab
   answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his
   hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.

   ^16And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord. So they
   made him ride in his chariot.

   ^17And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in
   Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the
   Lord, which he spake to Elijah.

   ^18And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab
   served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.

   ^19Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his
   servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great
   sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live.
   But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the
   worshippers of Baal.

   ^20And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they
   proclaimed it.

   ^21And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal
   came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came
   into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to
   another.

   ^22And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments
   for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.

   ^23And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of
   Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that
   there be here with you none of the servants of the Lord, but the
   worshippers of Baal only.

   ^24And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu
   appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I
   have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life
   shall be for the life of him.

   ^25And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the
   burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in,
   and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge
   of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to
   the city of the house of Baal.

   ^26And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and
   burned them.

   ^27And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of
   Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.

   ^28Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.

   ^29Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel
   to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves
   that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.

   ^30And the Lord said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in
   executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the
   house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of
   the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.

   ^31But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of Israel
   with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam,
   which made Israel to sin.

   ^32In those days the Lord began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote
   them in all the coasts of Israel;

   ^33From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the
   Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river
   Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.

   ^34Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his
   might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
   of Israel?

   ^35And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And
   Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.

   ^36And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and
   eight years.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 11

   And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she
   arose and destroyed all the seed royal.

   ^2But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took
   Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons
   which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the
   bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.

   ^3And he was with her hid in the house of the Lord six years. And
   Athaliah did reign over the land.

   ^4And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
   hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into
   the house of the Lord, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath
   of them in the house of the Lord, and shewed them the king's son.

   ^5And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A
   third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of
   the watch of the king's house;

   ^6And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the
   gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it
   be not broken down.

   ^7And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they
   shall keep the watch of the house of the Lord about the king.

   ^8And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons
   in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain:
   and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.

   ^9And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that
   Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that
   were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the
   sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.

   ^10And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's
   spears and shields, that were in the temple of the Lord.

   ^11And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round
   about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner
   of the temple, along by the altar and the temple.

   ^12And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and
   gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and
   they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.

   ^13And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people,
   she came to the people into the temple of the Lord.

   ^14And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the
   manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the
   people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent
   her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.

   ^15But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the
   officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the
   ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest
   had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the Lord.

   ^16And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the
   horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.

   ^17And Jehoiada made a covenant between the Lord and the king and the
   people, that they should be the Lord'S people; between the king also
   and the people.

   ^18And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and
   brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces
   thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And
   the priest appointed officers over the house of the Lord.

   ^19And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the
   guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king
   from the house of the Lord, and came by the way of the gate of the
   guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.

   ^20And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet:
   and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's house.

   ^21Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 12

   In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years
   reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zibiah of Beersheba.

   ^2And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all his
   days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.

   ^3But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed
   and burnt incense in the high places.

   ^4And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated
   things that is brought into the house of the Lord, even the money of
   every one that passeth the account, the money that every man is set at,
   and all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the
   house of the Lord,

   ^5Let the priests take it to them, every man of his acquaintance: and
   let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall
   be found.

   ^6But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash
   the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.

   ^7Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the other
   priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the
   house? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance, but
   deliver it for the breaches of the house.

   ^8And the priests consented to receive no more money of the people,
   neither to repair the breaches of the house.

   ^9But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of
   it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into
   the house of the Lord: and the priests that kept the door put therein
   all the money that was brought into the house of the Lord.

   ^10And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest,
   that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in
   bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the Lord.

   ^11And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did
   the work, that had the oversight of the house of the Lord: and they
   laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house
   of the Lord,

   ^12And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed
   stone to repair the breaches of the house of the Lord, and for all that
   was laid out for the house to repair it.

   ^13Howbeit there were not made for the house of the Lord bowls of
   silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of
   silver, of the money that was brought into the house of the Lord:

   ^14But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house
   of the Lord.

   ^15Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they
   delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt
   faithfully.

   ^16The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of
   the Lord: it was the priests'.

   ^17Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took
   it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.

   ^18And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that
   Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had
   dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found
   in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and in the king's house, and
   sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.

   ^19And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not
   written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

   ^20And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the
   house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.

   ^21For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer,
   his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his
   fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 13

   In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of
   Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria,
   and reigned seventeen years.

   ^2And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and followed
   the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he
   departed not therefrom.

   ^3And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he
   delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand
   of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days.

   ^4And Jehoahaz besought the Lord, and the Lord hearkened unto him: for
   he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed
   them.

   ^5(And the Lord gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under
   the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their
   tents, as beforetime.

   ^6Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of
   Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there remained
   the grove also in Samaria.)

   ^7Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen,
   and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had
   destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.

   ^8Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his
   might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
   of Israel?

   ^9And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria:
   and Joash his son reigned in his stead.

   ^10In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash
   the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned
   sixteen years.

   ^11And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord; he departed
   not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel
   sin: but he walked therein.

   ^12And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his
   might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not
   written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

   ^13And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne:
   and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.

   ^14Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And
   Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face,
   and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the
   horsemen thereof.

   ^15And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him
   bow and arrows.

   ^16And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow. And
   he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands upon the king's
   hands.

   ^17And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha
   said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the Lord'S
   deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt
   smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.

   ^18And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the
   king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed.

   ^19And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have
   smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou
   hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.

   ^20And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites
   invaded the land at the coming in of the year.

   ^21And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they
   spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of
   Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha,
   he revived, and stood up on his feet.

   ^22But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.

   ^23And the Lord was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and
   had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and
   Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his
   presence as yet.

   ^24So Hazael king of Syria died; and Ben- hadad his son reigned in his
   stead.

   ^25And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of
   Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the
   hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and
   recovered the cities of Israel.

    Chapter Kings 14

   In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned
   Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.

   ^2He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and reigned
   twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan
   of Jerusalem.

   ^3And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, yet not
   like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his
   father did.

   ^4Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did
   sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.

   ^5And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his
   hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.

   ^6But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that
   which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the Lord
   commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the
   children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every
   man shall be put to death for his own sin.

   ^7He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by
   war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.

   ^8Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of
   Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the
   face.

   ^9And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying,
   The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon,
   saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild
   beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.

   ^10Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up:
   glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to thy
   hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?

   ^11But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went
   up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at
   Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.

   ^12And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every
   man to their tents.

   ^13And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of
   Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth- shemesh, and came to Jerusalem,
   and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the
   corner gate, four hundred cubits.

   ^14And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were
   found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's
   house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.

   ^15Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and
   how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the
   book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

   ^16And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with
   the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.

   ^17And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of
   Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.

   ^18And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the
   book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

   ^19Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to
   Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.

   ^20And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with
   his fathers in the city of David.

   ^21And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen years
   old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.

   ^22He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept
   with his fathers.

   ^23In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah
   Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and
   reigned forty and one years.

   ^24And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed
   not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to
   sin.

   ^25He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the
   sea of the plain, according to the word of the Lord God of Israel,
   which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai,
   the prophet, which was of Gathhepher.

   ^26For the Lord saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter:
   for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel.

   ^27And the Lord said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from
   under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of
   Joash.

   ^28Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his
   might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which
   belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the
   chronicles of the kings of Israel?

   ^29And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel;
   and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 15

   In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah
   son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.

   ^2Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two
   and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jecholiah of
   Jerusalem.

   ^3And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according
   to all that his father Amaziah had done;

   ^4Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and
   burnt incense still on the high places.

   ^5And the Lord smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of
   his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king's son was
   over the house, judging the people of the land.

   ^6And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they
   not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

   ^7So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his
   fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.

   ^8In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah
   the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.

   ^9And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his
   fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of
   Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

   ^10And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him
   before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.

   ^11And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written in
   the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

   ^12This was the word of the Lord which he spake unto Jehu, saying, Thy
   sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation. And
   so it came to pass.

   ^13Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth
   year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.

   ^14For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to
   Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him,
   and reigned in his stead.

   ^15And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he
   made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
   kings of Israel.

   ^16Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the
   coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore
   he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped
   up.

   ^17In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began
   Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in
   Samaria.

   ^18And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed
   not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
   Israel to sin.

   ^19And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave
   Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to
   confirm the kingdom in his hand.

   ^20And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men
   of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of
   Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in
   the land.

   ^21And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they
   not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

   ^22And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in
   his stead.

   ^23In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of
   Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years.

   ^24And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed
   not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

   ^25But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against
   him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with
   Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he
   killed him, and reigned in his room.

   ^26And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold,
   they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

   ^27In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son
   of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty
   years.

   ^28And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he departed
   not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

   ^29In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of
   Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel-Bethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh,
   and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and
   carried them captive to Assyria.

   ^30And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son
   of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in
   the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.

   ^31And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they
   are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

   ^32In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began
   Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.

   ^33Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he
   reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jerusha,
   the daughter of Zadok.

   ^34And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord: he did
   according to all that his father Uzziah had done.

   ^35Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and
   burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of
   the house of the Lord.

   ^36Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they
   not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

   ^37In those days the Lord began to send against Judah Rezin the king of
   Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.

   ^38And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
   in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 16

   In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of
   Jotham king of Judah began to reign.

   ^2Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen
   years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the sight of
   the Lord his God, like David his father.

   ^3But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his
   son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the
   heathen, whom the Lord cast out from before the children of Israel.

   ^4And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the
   hills, and under every green tree.

   ^5Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel
   came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not
   overcome him.

   ^6At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave
   the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there
   unto this day.

   ^7So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I
   am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the
   king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up
   against me.

   ^8And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the
   Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a
   present to the king of Assyria.

   ^9And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria
   went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it
   captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.

   ^10And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of
   Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to
   Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it,
   according to all the workmanship thereof.

   ^11And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz
   had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king Ahaz
   came from Damascus.

   ^12And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar:
   and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.

   ^13And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured
   his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings,
   upon the altar.

   ^14And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the Lord,
   from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house
   of the Lord, and put it on the north side of the altar.

   ^15And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great
   altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering,
   and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt
   offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and
   their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt
   offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar
   shall be for me to enquire by.

   ^16Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz
   commanded.

   ^17And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the
   laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen
   that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones.

   ^18And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and
   the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the Lord for the
   king of Assyria.

   ^19Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written
   in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

   ^20And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in
   the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 17

   In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah
   to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.

   ^2And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, but not as
   the kings of Israel that were before him.

   ^3Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became
   his servant, and gave him presents.

   ^4And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent
   messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of
   Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria
   shut him up, and bound him in prison.

   ^5Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up
   to Samaria, and besieged it three years.

   ^6In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and
   carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor
   by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.

   ^7For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the
   Lord their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt,
   from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other
   gods,

   ^8And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the Lord cast out
   from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which
   they had made.

   ^9And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not
   right against the Lord their God, and they built them high places in
   all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.

   ^10And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under
   every green tree:

   ^11And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the
   heathen whom the Lord carried away before them; and wrought wicked
   things to provoke the Lord to anger:

   ^12For they served idols, whereof the Lord had said unto them, Ye shall
   not do this thing.

   ^13Yet the Lord testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the
   prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways,
   and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law
   which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants
   the prophets.

   ^14Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like
   to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the Lord their
   God.

   ^15And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with
   their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and
   they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that
   were round about them, concerning whom the Lord had charged them, that
   they should not do like them.

   ^16And they left all the commandments of the Lord their God, and made
   them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped
   all the host of heaven, and served Baal.

   ^17And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the
   fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do
   evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.

   ^18Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them out
   of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only.

   ^19Also Judah kept not the commandments of the Lord their God, but
   walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.

   ^20And the Lord rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them,
   and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them
   out of his sight.

   ^21For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam
   the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the
   Lord, and made them sin a great sin.

   ^22For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which
   he did; they departed not from them;

   ^23Until the Lord removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by
   all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their
   own land to Assyria unto this day.

   ^24And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah,
   and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in
   the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they
   possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.

   ^25And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they
   feared not the Lord: therefore the Lord sent lions among them, which
   slew some of them.

   ^26Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations
   which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not
   the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among
   them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of
   the God of the land.

   ^27Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the
   priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there,
   and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land.

   ^28Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came
   and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the Lord.

   ^29Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the
   houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation
   in their cities wherein they dwelt.

   ^30And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made
   Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,

   ^31And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt
   their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of
   Sepharvaim.

   ^32So they feared the Lord, and made unto themselves of the lowest of
   them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the
   houses of the high places.

   ^33They feared the Lord, and served their own gods, after the manner of
   the nations whom they carried away from thence.

   ^34Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the
   Lord, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances,
   or after the law and commandment which the Lord commanded the children
   of Jacob, whom he named Israel;

   ^35With whom the Lord had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye
   shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them,
   nor sacrifice to them:

   ^36But the Lord, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great
   power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye
   worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.

   ^37And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the
   commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for
   evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.

   ^38And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget;
   neither shall ye fear other gods.

   ^39But the Lord your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of
   the hand of all your enemies.

   ^40Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former
   manner.

   ^41So these nations feared the Lord, and served their graven images,
   both their children, and their children's children: as did their
   fathers, so do they unto this day.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 18

   Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of
   Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.

   ^2Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he
   reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was
   Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.

   ^3And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according
   to all that David his father did.

   ^4He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the
   groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for
   unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he
   called it Nehushtan.

   ^5He trusted in the Lord God of Israel; so that after him was none like
   him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.

   ^6For he clave to the Lord, and departed not from following him, but
   kept his commandments, which the Lord commanded Moses.

   ^7And the Lord was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went
   forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not.

   ^8He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof,
   from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.

   ^9And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was
   the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser
   king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it.

   ^10And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth year
   of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria
   was taken.

   ^11And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put
   them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of
   the Medes:

   ^12Because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord their God, but
   transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the Lord
   commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.

   ^13Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of
   Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.

   ^14And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish,
   saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me
   will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of
   Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.

   ^15And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of
   the Lord, and in the treasures of the king's house.

   ^16At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the
   temple of the Lord, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah
   had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.

   ^17And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from
   Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they
   went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came
   and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of
   the fuller's field.

   ^18And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim
   the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the
   scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.

   ^19And Rab- shakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith
   the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein
   thou trustest?

   ^20Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and
   strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest
   against me?

   ^21Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even
   upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and
   pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.

   ^22But if ye say unto me, We trust in the Lord our God: is not that he,
   whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath
   said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in
   Jerusalem?

   ^23Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of
   Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able
   on thy part to set riders upon them.

   ^24How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of
   my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for
   horsemen?

   ^25Am I now come up without the Lord against this place to destroy it?
   The Lord said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.

   ^26Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto
   Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language;
   for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the
   ears of the people that are on the wall.

   ^27But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master,
   and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men which
   sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own
   piss with you?

   ^28Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews'
   language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king
   of Assyria:

   ^29Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not
   be able to deliver you out of his hand:

   ^30Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord, saying, The Lord
   will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the
   hand of the king of Assyria.

   ^31Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make an
   agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat ye
   every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye
   every one the waters of his cistern:

   ^32Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land
   of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive
   and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto
   Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The Lord will deliver us.

   ^33Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of
   the hand of the king of Assyria?

   ^34Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods of
   Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine
   hand?

   ^35Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have
   delivered their country out of mine hand, that the Lord should deliver
   Jerusalem out of mine hand?

   ^36But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for
   the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.

   ^37Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household,
   and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to
   Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 19

   And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his
   clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of
   the Lord.

   ^2And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna the
   scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to
   Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

   ^3And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of
   trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children are come to the
   birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.

   ^4It may be the Lord thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom
   the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God;
   and will reprove the words which the Lord thy God hath heard: wherefore
   lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left.

   ^5So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

   ^6And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus
   saith the Lord, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with
   which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.

   ^7Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and
   shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword
   in his own land.

   ^8So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against
   Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.

   ^9And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is
   come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah,
   saying,

   ^10Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy
   God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be
   delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

   ^11Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all
   lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered?

   ^12Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have
   destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden
   which were in Thelasar?

   ^13Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of
   the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?

   ^14And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and
   read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the Lord, and spread it
   before the Lord.

   ^15And Hezekiah prayed before the Lord, and said, O Lord God of Israel,
   which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou
   alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and
   earth.

   ^16Lord, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, Lord, thine eyes, and see:
   and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the
   living God.

   ^17Of a truth, Lord, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations
   and their lands,

   ^18And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but
   the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed
   them.

   ^19Now therefore, O Lord our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of
   his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the
   Lord God, even thou only.

   ^20Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the
   Lord God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against
   Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.

   ^21This is the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning him; The
   virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to
   scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.

   ^22Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou
   exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the
   Holy One of Israel.

   ^23By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With
   the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the
   mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar
   trees thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into
   the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.

   ^24I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet
   have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.

   ^25Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of ancient
   times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou
   shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.

   ^26Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed
   and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green
   herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be
   grown up.

   ^27But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy
   rage against me.

   ^28Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine
   ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy
   lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.

   ^29And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such
   things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which
   springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and
   plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.

   ^30And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet
   again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.

   ^31For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape
   out of mount Zion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this.

   ^32Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, He
   shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come
   before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.

   ^33By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not
   come into this city, saith the Lord.

   ^34For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for
   my servant David's sake.

   ^35And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the Lord went out,
   and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five
   thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were
   all dead corpses.

   ^36So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and
   dwelt at Nineveh.

   ^37And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch
   his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the
   sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esar- haddon his
   son reigned in his stead.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 20

   In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the
   son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Set
   thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.

   ^2Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord,
   saying,

   ^3I beseech thee, O Lord, remember now how I have walked before thee in
   truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy
   sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.

   ^4And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court,
   that the word of the Lord came to him, saying,

   ^5Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith
   the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have
   seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt
   go up unto the house of the Lord.

   ^6And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee
   and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend
   this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.

   ^7And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on
   the boil, and he recovered.

   ^8And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the Lord
   will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the Lord the
   third day?

   ^9And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the Lord, that the Lord
   will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten
   degrees, or go back ten degrees?

   ^10And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down
   ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.

   ^11And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the Lord: and he brought the
   shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of
   Ahaz.

   ^12At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon,
   sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that
   Hezekiah had been sick.

   ^13And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of
   his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the
   precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was
   found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his
   dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.

   ^14Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him,
   What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah
   said, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.

   ^15And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
   answered, All the things that are in mine house have they seen: there
   is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.

   ^16And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the Lord.

   ^17Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that
   which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried
   into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the Lord.

   ^18And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget,
   shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the
   king of Babylon.

   ^19Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord which
   thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in
   my days?

   ^20And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he
   made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, are they
   not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

   ^21And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in
   his stead.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 21

   Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty
   and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hephzibah.

   ^2And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, after the
   abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord cast out before the children
   of Israel.

   ^3For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had
   destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did
   Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served
   them.

   ^4And he built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord said,
   In Jerusalem will I put my name.

   ^5And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of
   the house of the Lord.

   ^6And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and
   used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he
   wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to
   anger.

   ^7And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house,
   of which the Lord said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house,
   and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will
   I put my name for ever:

   ^8Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land
   which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according
   to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my
   servant Moses commanded them.

   ^9But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil
   than did the nations whom the Lord destroyed before the children of
   Israel.

   ^10And the Lord spake by his servants the prophets, saying,

   ^11Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and
   hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before
   him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols:

   ^12Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing
   such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both
   his ears shall tingle.

   ^13And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the
   plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth
   a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.

   ^14And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them
   into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a
   spoil to all their enemies;

   ^15Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have
   provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of
   Egypt, even unto this day.

   ^16Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled
   Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made
   Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.

   ^17Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his
   sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles
   of the kings of Judah?

   ^18And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of
   his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his
   stead.

   ^19Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he
   reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Meshullemeth,
   the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.

   ^20And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his
   father Manasseh did.

   ^21And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served
   the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:

   ^22And he forsook the Lord God of his fathers, and walked not in the
   way of the Lord.

   ^23And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in
   his own house.

   ^24And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against
   king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his
   stead.

   ^25Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written
   in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

   ^26And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah
   his son reigned in his stead.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 22

   Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
   thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jedidah,
   the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.

   ^2And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked
   in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right
   hand or to the left.

   ^3And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the
   king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe,
   to the house of the Lord, saying,

   ^4Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is
   brought into the house of the Lord, which the keepers of the door have
   gathered of the people:

   ^5And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that
   have the oversight of the house of the Lord: and let them give it to
   the doers of the work which is in the house of the Lord, to repair the
   breaches of the house,

   ^6Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn
   stone to repair the house.

   ^7Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was
   delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.

   ^8And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have
   found the book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Hilkiah gave
   the book to Shaphan, and he read it.

   ^9And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word
   again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in
   the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the
   work, that have the oversight of the house of the Lord.

   ^10And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest
   hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.

   ^11And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book
   of the law, that he rent his clothes.

   ^12And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of
   Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and
   Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,

   ^13Go ye, enquire of the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all
   Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is
   the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us, because our fathers
   have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto
   all that which is written concerning us.

   ^14So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and
   Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son
   of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in
   Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.

   ^15And she said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Tell the
   man that sent you to me,

   ^16Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and
   upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the
   king of Judah hath read:

   ^17Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other
   gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their
   hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and
   shall not be quenched.

   ^18But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the Lord, thus
   shall ye say to him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, As touching the
   words which thou hast heard;

   ^19Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before
   the Lord, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and
   against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation
   and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have
   heard thee, saith the Lord.

   ^20Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou
   shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see
   all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the
   king word again.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 23

   And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah
   and of Jerusalem.

   ^2And the king went up into the house of the Lord, and all the men of
   Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests,
   and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read
   in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found
   in the house of the Lord.

   ^3And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the Lord,
   to walk after the Lord, and to keep his commandments and his
   testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul,
   to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book.
   And all the people stood to the covenant.

   ^4And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of
   the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of
   the temple of the Lord all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for
   the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without
   Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto
   Bethel.

   ^5And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had
   ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and
   in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto
   Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the
   host of heaven.

   ^6And he brought out the grove from the house of the Lord, without
   Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron,
   and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the
   graves of the children of the people.

   ^7And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house
   of the Lord, where the women wove hangings for the grove.

   ^8And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and
   defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba
   to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in
   the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which
   were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city.

   ^9Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar
   of the Lord in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread
   among their brethren.

   ^10And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of
   Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through
   the fire to Molech.

   ^11And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the
   sun, at the entering in of the house of the Lord, by the chamber of
   Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the
   chariots of the sun with fire.

   ^12And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz,
   which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had
   made in the two courts of the house of the Lord, did the king beat
   down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into
   the brook Kidron.

   ^13And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the
   right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel
   had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for
   Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination
   of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.

   ^14And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and
   filled their places with the bones of men.

   ^15Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which
   Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that
   altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and
   stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove.

   ^16And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were
   there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres,
   and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word
   of the Lord which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these
   words.

   ^17Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city
   told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah,
   and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of
   Bethel.

   ^18And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let
   his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of
   Samaria.

   ^19And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities
   of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to
   anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that
   he had done in Bethel.

   ^20And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon
   the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and returned to
   Jerusalem.

   ^21And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover
   unto the Lord your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.

   ^22Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the
   judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel,
   nor of the kings of Judah;

   ^23But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was
   holden to the Lord in Jerusalem.

   ^24Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the
   images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the
   land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might
   perform the words of the law which were written in the book that
   Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the Lord.

   ^25And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the
   Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might,
   according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any
   like him.

   ^26Notwithstanding the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great
   wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all
   the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal.

   ^27And the Lord said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I
   have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have
   chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there.

   ^28Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they
   not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

   ^29In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of
   Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and
   he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.

   ^30And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and
   brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the
   people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him,
   and made him king in his father's stead.

   ^31Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and
   he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
   Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

   ^32And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according
   to all that his fathers had done.

   ^33And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath,
   that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of
   an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold.

   ^34And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of
   Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz
   away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.

   ^35And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed
   the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he
   exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one
   according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaohnechoh.

   ^36Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and
   he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
   Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.

   ^37And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according
   to all that his fathers had done.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 24

   In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim
   became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against
   him.

   ^2And the Lord sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the
   Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon,
   and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the
   Lord, which he spake by his servants the prophets.

   ^3Surely at the commandment of the Lord came this upon Judah, to remove
   them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that
   he did;

   ^4And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem
   with innocent blood; which the Lord would not pardon.

   ^5Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are they
   not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

   ^6So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned
   in his stead.

   ^7And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for
   the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river
   Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.

   ^8Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he
   reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name was Nehushta,
   the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.

   ^9And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to
   all that his father had done.

   ^10At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up
   against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.

   ^11And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his
   servants did besiege it.

   ^12And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon,
   he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his
   officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his
   reign.

   ^13And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the
   Lord, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the
   vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of
   the Lord, as the Lord had said.

   ^14And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the
   mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen
   and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the
   land.

   ^15And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother,
   and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land,
   those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.

   ^16And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen and
   smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them the
   king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.

   ^17And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in
   his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.

   ^18Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he
   reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal,
   the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

   ^19And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according
   to all that Jehoiakim had done.

   ^20For through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and
   Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah
   rebelled against the king of Babylon.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Kings 25

   And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month,
   in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
   came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it;
   and they built forts against it round about.

   ^2And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.

   ^3And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the
   city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.

   ^4And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by
   the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden:
   (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went
   the way toward the plain.

   ^5And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him
   in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.

   ^6So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to
   Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.

   ^7And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the
   eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him
   to Babylon.

   ^8And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the
   nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came
   Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon,
   unto Jerusalem:

   ^9And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king's house, and all the
   houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's house burnt he with fire.

   ^10And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the
   guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.

   ^11Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the
   fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of
   the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away.

   ^12But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be
   vinedressers and husbandmen.

   ^13And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord, and the
   bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the Lord, did the
   Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.

   ^14And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and
   all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.

   ^15And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in
   gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.

   ^16The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for
   the house of the Lord; the brass of all these vessels was without
   weight.

   ^17The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter
   upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and the
   wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of
   brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work.

   ^18And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and
   Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:

   ^19And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of
   war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were
   found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered
   the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land
   that were found in the city:

   ^20And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to
   the king of Babylon to Riblah:

   ^21And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the
   land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.

   ^22And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom
   Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made
   Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.

   ^23And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard
   that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to
   Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the
   son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and
   Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.

   ^24And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them,
   Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and
   serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.

   ^25But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of
   Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men
   with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the
   Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.

   ^26And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the
   armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees.

   ^27And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity
   of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and
   twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the
   year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of
   Judah out of prison;

   ^28And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of
   the kings that were with him in Babylon;

   ^29And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually
   before him all the days of his life.

   ^30And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a
   daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.

    Chapter Chronicles 5

   Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was the
   firstborn; but, forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed, his
   birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the
   genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.

   ^2For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief
   ruler; but the birthright was Joseph's:)

   ^3The sons, I say, of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were, Hanoch, and
   Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

   ^4The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,

   ^5Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son,

   ^6Beerah his son, whom Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria carried away
   captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.

   ^7And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of their
   generations was reckoned, were the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah,

   ^8And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who
   dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon:

   ^9And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the wilderness from
   the river Euphrates: because their cattle were multiplied in the land
   of Gilead.

   ^10And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell
   by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the east
   land of Gilead.

   ^11And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land of
   Bashan unto Salchah:

   ^12Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat in
   Bashan.

   ^13And their brethren of the house of their fathers were, Michael, and
   Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and Zia, and Heber, seven.

   ^14These are the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of
   Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai,
   the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;

   ^15Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of their
   fathers.

   ^16And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in all the
   suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders.

   ^17All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of
   Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.

   ^18The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh,
   of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with
   bow, and skilful in war, were four and forty thousand seven hundred and
   threescore, that went out to the war.

   ^19And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and
   Nodab.

   ^20And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered
   into their hand, and all that were with them: for they cried to God in
   the battle, and he was intreated of them; because they put their trust
   in him.

   ^21And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and
   of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and
   of men an hundred thousand.

   ^22For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God. And they
   dwelt in their steads until the captivity.

   ^23And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land:
   they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir, and unto mount
   Hermon.

   ^24And these were the heads of the house of their fathers, even Epher,
   and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and
   Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, and heads of the house of
   their fathers.

   ^25And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a
   whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed
   before them.

   ^26And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria,
   and the spirit of Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them
   away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of
   Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the
   river Gozan, unto this day.

    Chapter Chronicles 9

   So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they were
   written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, who were carried
   away to Babylon for their transgression.

   ^2Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their
   cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims.

   ^3And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children
   of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh;

   ^4Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son
   of Bani, of the children of Pharez the son of Judah.

   ^5And of the Shilonites; Asaiah the firstborn, and his sons.

   ^6And of the sons of Zerah; Jeuel, and their brethren, six hundred and
   ninety.

   ^7And of the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of
   Hodaviah, the son of Hasenuah,

   ^8And Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of Uzzi, the son of
   Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephatiah, the son of Reuel, the son
   of Ibnijah;

   ^9And their brethren, according to their generations, nine hundred and
   fifty and six. All these men were chief of the fathers in the house of
   their fathers.

   ^10And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin,

   ^11And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of
   Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house
   of God;

   ^12And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of
   Malchijah, and Maasiai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son
   of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer;

   ^13And their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a thousand
   and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for the work of the
   service of the house of God.

   ^14And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam,
   the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;

   ^15And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Micah,
   the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;

   ^16And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of
   Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, that dwelt
   in the villages of the Netophathites.

   ^17And the porters were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman,
   and their brethren: Shallum was the chief;

   ^18Who hitherto waited in the king's gate eastward: they were porters
   in the companies of the children of Levi.

   ^19And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah,
   and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over
   the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and
   their fathers, being over the host of the Lord, were keepers of the
   entry.

   ^20And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time
   past, and the Lord was with him.

   ^21And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation.

   ^22All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two
   hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their
   villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set
   office.

   ^23So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the
   house of the Lord, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards.

   ^24In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and
   south.

   ^25And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come after
   seven days from time to time with them.

   ^26For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office,
   and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.

   ^27And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge was
   upon them, and the opening thereof every morning pertained to them.

   ^28And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels, that
   they should bring them in and out by tale.

   ^29Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the
   instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the
   oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.

   ^30And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices.

   ^31And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum
   the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the
   pans.

   ^32And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were
   over the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath.

   ^33And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who
   remaining in the chambers were free: for they were employed in that
   work day and night.

   ^34These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their
   generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.

   ^35And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name
   was Maachah:

   ^36And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner,
   and Nadab,

   ^37And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.

   ^38And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren
   at Jerusalem, over against their brethren.

   ^39And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan,
   and Malchi-shua, and Abinadab, and Esh-baal.

   ^40And the son of Jonathan was Merib- baal: and Merib-baal begat Micah.

   ^41And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, and
   Ahaz.

   ^42And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and
   Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza;

   ^43And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel
   his son.

   ^44And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and
   Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these were the sons of
   Azel.

    Chapter Chronicles 10

   Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled
   from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.

   ^2And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and
   the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons
   of Saul.

   ^3And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and
   he was wounded of the archers.

   ^4Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me
   through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his
   armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword,
   and fell upon it.

   ^5And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on
   the sword, and died.

   ^6So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.

   ^7And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they
   fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their
   cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.

   ^8And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip
   the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.

   ^9And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour,
   and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings
   unto their idols, and to the people.

   ^10And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his
   head in the temple of Dagon.

   ^11And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to
   Saul,

   ^12They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and
   the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their
   bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

   ^13So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the
   Lord, even against the word of the Lord, which he kept not, and also
   for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it;

   ^14And enquired not of the Lord: therefore he slew him, and turned the
   kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 11

   Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying,
   Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

   ^2And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that
   leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the Lord thy God said unto
   thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my
   people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.

   ^3Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and
   David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord; and they
   anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the Lord by
   Samuel.

   ^4And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the
   Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.

   ^5And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come
   hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city
   of David.

   ^6And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief
   and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.

   ^7And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of
   David.

   ^8And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and
   Joab repaired the rest of the city.

   ^9So David waxed greater and greater: for the Lord of hosts was with
   him.

   ^10These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who
   strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel,
   to make him king, according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel.

   ^11And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam,
   and Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear
   against three hundred slain by him at one time.

   ^12And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one
   of the three mighties.

   ^13He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were
   gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of
   barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.

   ^14And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered
   it, and slew the Philistines; and the Lord saved them by a great
   deliverance.

   ^15Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David,
   into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in
   the valley of Rephaim.

   ^16And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was
   then at Bethlehem.

   ^17And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the
   water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!

   ^18And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew
   water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it,
   and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it
   out to the Lord,

   ^19And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I
   drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for
   with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would
   not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.

   ^20And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for
   lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a
   name among the three.

   ^21Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their
   captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.

   ^22Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel,
   who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went
   down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.

   ^23And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high;
   and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he
   went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the
   Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.

   ^24These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among
   the three mighties.

   ^25Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the
   first three: and David set him over his guard.

   ^26Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of Joab,
   Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

   ^27Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,

   ^28Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite,

   ^29Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,

   ^30Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,

   ^31Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that pertained to the children of
   Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,

   ^32Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,

   ^33Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,

   ^34The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the
   Hararite,

   ^35Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,

   ^36Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,

   ^37Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,

   ^38Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,

   ^39Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab
   the son of Zeruiah,

   ^40Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,

   ^41Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,

   ^42Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites,
   and thirty with him,

   ^43Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,

   ^44Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the
   Aroerite,

   ^45Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,

   ^46Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam,
   and Ithmah the Moabite,

   ^47Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.

    Chapter Chronicles 12

   Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept
   himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among the
   mighty men, helpers of the war.

   ^2They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the
   left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul's
   brethren of Benjamin.

   ^3The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the
   Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah,
   and Jehu the Antothite,

   ^4And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over
   the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the
   Gederathite,

   ^5Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the
   Haruphite,

   ^6Elkanah, and Jesiah, and PrAzareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the
   Korhites,

   ^7And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.

   ^8And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the
   hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the battle,
   that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces
   of lions, and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains;

   ^9Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,

   ^10Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,

   ^11Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,

   ^12Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,

   ^13Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.

   ^14These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the
   least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.

   ^15These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had
   overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the
   valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.

   ^16And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold
   unto David.

   ^17And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If
   ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto
   you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no
   wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke
   it.

   ^18Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and
   he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse:
   peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God
   helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the
   band.

   ^19And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the
   Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the
   lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will
   fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.

   ^20As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and
   Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai,
   captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.

   ^21And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were
   all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.

   ^22For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until
   it was a great host, like the host of God.

   ^23And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the
   war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him,
   according to the word of the Lord.

   ^24The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand
   and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.

   ^25Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven
   thousand and one hundred.

   ^26Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.

   ^27And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were
   three thousand and seven hundred;

   ^28And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's house
   twenty and two captains.

   ^29And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three
   thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of
   the house of Saul.

   ^30And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred,
   mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers.

   ^31And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were
   expressed by name, to come and make David king.

   ^32And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had
   understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads
   of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their
   commandment.

   ^33Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all
   instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they were
   not of double heart.

   ^34And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and
   spear thirty and seven thousand.

   ^35And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six
   hundred.

   ^36And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty
   thousand.

   ^37And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites,
   and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of
   war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.

   ^38All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect
   heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest
   also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.

   ^39And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for
   their brethren had prepared for them.

   ^40Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and Zebulun
   and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and
   on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and
   wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in
   Israel.

    Chapter Chronicles 13

   And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and
   with every leader.

   ^2And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good
   unto you, and that it be of the Lord our God, let us send abroad unto
   our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and
   with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and
   suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:

   ^3And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not
   at it in the days of Saul.

   ^4And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing
   was right in the eyes of all the people.

   ^5So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto
   the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.

   ^6And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjath-
   jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the
   Lord, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it.

   ^7And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of
   Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.

   ^8And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and
   with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels,
   and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

   ^9And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth
   his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.

   ^10And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzza, and he smote
   him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.

   ^11And David was displeased, because the Lord had made a breach upon
   Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.

   ^12And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the
   ark of God home to me?

   ^13So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David,
   but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.

   ^14And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house
   three months. And the Lord blessed the house of Obededom, and all that
   he had.

    Chapter Chronicles 14

   Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars,
   with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.

   ^2And David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel,
   for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.

   ^3And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and
   daughters.

   ^4Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem;
   Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

   ^5And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,

   ^6And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

   ^7And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.

   ^8And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all
   Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of
   it, and went out against them.

   ^9And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of
   Rephaim.

   ^10And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the
   Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the Lord
   said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.

   ^11So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then
   David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the
   breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place
   Baalperazim.

   ^12And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment,
   and they were burned with fire.

   ^13And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the
   valley.

   ^14Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not
   up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the
   mulberry trees.

   ^15And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops
   of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God
   is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.

   ^16David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of
   the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.

   ^17And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the Lord brought
   the fear of him upon all nations.

    Chapter Chronicles 15

   And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place
   for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.

   ^2Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites:
   for them hath the Lord chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister
   unto him for ever.

   ^3And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the
   ark of the Lord unto his place, which he had prepared for it.

   ^4And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:

   ^5Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred
   and twenty:

   ^6Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred
   and twenty:

   ^7Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred
   and thirty:

   ^8Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two
   hundred:

   ^9Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:

   ^10Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an
   hundred and twelve.

   ^11And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the
   Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and
   Amminadab,

   ^12And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites:
   sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up
   the ark of the Lord God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared
   for it.

   ^13For because ye did it not at the first, the Lord our God made a
   breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.

   ^14So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the
   ark of the Lord God of Israel.

   ^15And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their
   shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the
   word of the Lord.

   ^16And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their
   brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and
   harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.

   ^17So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren,
   Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren,
   Ethan the son of Kushaiah;

   ^18And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben,
   and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah,
   and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and
   Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.

   ^19So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound
   with cymbals of brass;

   ^20And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and
   Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;

   ^21And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and
   Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.

   ^22And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed
   about the song, because he was skilful.

   ^23And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.

   ^24And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and
   Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the
   trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were
   doorkeepers for the ark.

   ^25So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands,
   went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the house
   of Obededom with joy.

   ^26And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark
   of the covenant of the Lord, that they offered seven bullocks and seven
   rams.

   ^27And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites
   that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the
   song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen.

   ^28Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with
   shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with
   cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.

   ^29And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the Lord came to
   the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a
   window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her
   heart.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 16

   So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent
   that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and
   peace offerings before God.

   ^2And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and
   the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord.

   ^3And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one
   a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.

   ^4And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of
   the Lord, and to record, and to thank and praise the Lord God of
   Israel:

   ^5Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth,
   and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and
   Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with
   cymbals;

   ^6Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually
   before the ark of the covenant of God.

   ^7Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the Lord
   into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.

   ^8Give thanks unto the Lord, call upon his name, make known his deeds
   among the people.

   ^9Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous
   works.

   ^10Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek
   the Lord.

   ^11Seek the Lord and his strength, seek his face continually.

   ^12Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and
   the judgments of his mouth;

   ^13O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen
   ones.

   ^14He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth.

   ^15Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to
   a thousand generations;

   ^16Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath
   unto Isaac;

   ^17And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an
   everlasting covenant,

   ^18Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your
   inheritance;

   ^19When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.

   ^20And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to
   another people;

   ^21He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for
   their sakes,

   ^22Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

   ^23Sing unto the Lord, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his
   salvation.

   ^24Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all
   nations.

   ^25For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be
   feared above all gods.

   ^26For all the gods of the people are idols: but the Lord made the
   heavens.

   ^27Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in
   his place.

   ^28Give unto the Lord, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord
   glory and strength.

   ^29Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: bring an offering,
   and come before him: worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness.

   ^30Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that
   it be not moved.

   ^31Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say
   among the nations, The Lord reigneth.

   ^32Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice,
   and all that is therein.

   ^33Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the
   Lord, because he cometh to judge the earth.

   ^34O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; for his mercy endureth
   for ever.

   ^35And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together,
   and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy
   name, and glory in thy praise.

   ^36Blessed be the Lord God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the
   people said, Amen, and praised the Lord.

   ^37So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the Lord Asaph
   and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every
   day's work required:

   ^38And Obed- edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom
   also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters:

   ^39And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the
   tabernacle of the Lord in the high place that was at Gibeon,

   ^40To offer burnt offerings unto the Lord upon the altar of the burnt
   offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all
   that is written in the law of the Lord, which he commanded Israel;

   ^41And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who
   were expressed by name, to give thanks to the Lord, because his mercy
   endureth for ever;

   ^42And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those
   that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the
   sons of Jeduthun were porters.

   ^43And all the people departed every man to his house: and David
   returned to bless his house.

    Chapter Chronicles 17

   Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to
   Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of
   the covenant of the Lord remaineth under curtains.

   ^2Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God
   is with thee.

   ^3And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to
   Nathan, saying,

   ^4Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not
   build me an house to dwell in:

   ^5For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up
   Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one
   tabernacle to another.

   ^6Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of
   the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why
   have ye not built me an house of cedars?

   ^7Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith
   the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following
   the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:

   ^8And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have
   cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name
   like the name of the great men that are in the earth.

   ^9Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them,
   and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more;
   neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the
   beginning,

   ^10And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people
   Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell
   thee that the Lord will build thee an house.

   ^11And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must
   go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee,
   which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.

   ^12He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.

   ^13I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my
   mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee:

   ^14But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and
   his throne shall be established for evermore.

   ^15According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so
   did Nathan speak unto David.

   ^16And David the king came and sat before the Lord, and said, Who am I,
   O Lord God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?

   ^17And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast
   also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast
   regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Lord
   God.

   ^18What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for
   thou knowest thy servant.

   ^19O Lord, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart,
   hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great
   things.

   ^20O Lord, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside
   thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.

   ^21And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God
   went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness
   and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom
   thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?

   ^22For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and
   thou, Lord, becamest their God.

   ^23Therefore now, Lord, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning
   thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as
   thou hast said.

   ^24Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever,
   saying, The Lord of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel:
   and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.

   ^25For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him
   an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before
   thee.

   ^26And now, Lord, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto
   thy servant:

   ^27Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant,
   that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O Lord, and it
   shall be blessed for ever.

    Chapter Chronicles 18

   Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and
   subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the
   Philistines.

   ^2And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and
   brought gifts.

   ^3And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to
   stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.

   ^4And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand
   horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the
   chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.

   ^5And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of
   Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.

   ^6Then David put garrisons in Syria-damascus; and the Syrians became
   David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the Lord preserved David
   whithersoever he went.

   ^7And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of
   Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

   ^8Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought
   David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the
   pillars, and the vessels of brass.

   ^9Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host
   of Hadarezer king of Zobah;

   ^10He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare,
   and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and
   smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner
   of vessels of gold and silver and brass.

   ^11Them also king David dedicated unto the Lord, with the silver and
   the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from
   Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and
   from Amalek.

   ^12Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the
   valley of salt eighteen thousand.

   ^13And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's
   servants. Thus the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went.

   ^14So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice
   among all his people.

   ^15And Joab the son Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son
   of Ahilud, recorder.

   ^16And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were
   the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;

   ^17And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the
   Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 19

   Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of
   Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.

   ^2And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash,
   because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to
   comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into
   the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.

   ^3But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou
   that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto
   thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to
   overthrow, and to spy out the land?

   ^4Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off
   their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.

   ^5Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And
   he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king
   said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.

   ^6And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves
   odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand
   talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of
   Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.

   ^7So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of
   Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the
   children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and
   came to battle.

   ^8And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the
   mighty men.

   ^9And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array
   before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by
   themselves in the field.

   ^10Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and
   behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array
   against the Syrians.

   ^11And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his
   brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of
   Ammon.

   ^12And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt
   help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I
   will help thee.

   ^13Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our
   people, and for the cities of our God: and let the Lord do that which
   is good in his sight.

   ^14So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the
   Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.

   ^15And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they
   likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city.
   Then Joab came to Jerusalem.

   ^16And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before
   Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were
   beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer
   went before them.

   ^17And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over
   Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them.
   So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they
   fought with him.

   ^18But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians
   seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand
   footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.

   ^19And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the
   worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his
   servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any
   more.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 20

   And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that
   kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and
   wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged
   Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and
   destroyed it.

   ^2And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found
   it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and
   it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil
   out of the city.

   ^3And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with
   saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with
   all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people
   returned to Jerusalem.

   ^4And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with
   the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai,
   that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.

   ^5And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of
   Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff
   was like a weaver's beam.

   ^6And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great
   stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand,
   and six on each foot: and he also was the son of the giant.

   ^7But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother
   slew him.

   ^8These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of
   David, and by the hand of his servants.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 21

   And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.

   ^2And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number
   Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me,
   that I may know it.

   ^3And Joab answered, The Lord make his people an hundred times so many
   more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's
   servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a
   cause of trespass to Israel?

   ^4Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab
   departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.

   ^5And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all
   they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men
   that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand
   men that drew sword.

   ^6But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word
   was abominable to Joab.

   ^7And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.

   ^8And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done
   this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy
   servant; for I have done very foolishly.

   ^9And the Lord spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,

   ^10Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the Lord, I offer thee three
   things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.

   ^11So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Choose
   thee

   ^12Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before
   thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or
   else three days the sword of the Lord, even the pestilence, in the
   land, and the angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the coasts of
   Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to
   him that sent me.

   ^13And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now
   into the hand of the Lord; for very great are his mercies: but let me
   not fall into the hand of man.

   ^14So the Lord sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel
   seventy thousand men.

   ^15And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was
   destroying, the Lord beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said
   to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the
   angel of the Lord stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

   ^16And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the Lord stand
   between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand
   stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who
   were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.

   ^17And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be
   numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as
   for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O
   Lord my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people,
   that they should be plagued.

   ^18Then the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to say to David, that David
   should go up, and set up an altar unto the Lord in the threshingfloor
   of Ornan the Jebusite.

   ^19And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name
   of the Lord.

   ^20And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him
   hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.

   ^21And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out
   of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the
   ground.

   ^22Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor,
   that I may build an altar therein unto the Lord: thou shalt grant it me
   for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.

   ^23And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king
   do that which is good in his eyes: lo,I give thee the oxen also for
   burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat
   for the meat offering; I give it all.

   ^24And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the
   full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the Lord, nor
   offer burnt offerings without cost.

   ^25So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by
   weight.

   ^26And David built there an altar unto the Lord, and offered burnt
   offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the Lord; and he
   answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.

   ^27And the Lord commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into
   the sheath thereof.

   ^28At that time when David saw that the Lord had answered him in the
   threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.

   ^29For the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in the wilderness,
   and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high
   place at Gibeon.

   ^30But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was
   afraid because of the sword of the angel of the Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 22

   Then David said, This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the
   altar of the burnt offering for Israel.

   ^2And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the
   land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the
   house of God.

   ^3And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of
   the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;

   ^4Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre
   brought much cedar wood to David.

   ^5And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house
   that is to be builded for the Lord must be exceeding magnifical, of
   fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make
   preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.

   ^6Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house
   for the Lord God of Israel.

   ^7And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to
   build an house unto the name of the Lord my God:

   ^8But the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood
   abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house
   unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my
   sight.

   ^9Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and
   I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name
   shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in
   his days.

   ^10He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I
   will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over
   Israel for ever.

   ^11Now, my son, the Lord be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the
   house of the Lord thy God, as he hath said of thee.

   ^12Only the Lord give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee
   charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the Lord thy
   God.

   ^13Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes
   and judgments which the Lord charged Moses with concerning Israel: be
   strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.

   ^14Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the Lord
   an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of
   silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance:
   timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.

   ^15Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and
   workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every
   manner of work.

   ^16Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no
   number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the Lord be with thee.

   ^17David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his
   son, saying,

   ^18Is not the Lord your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on
   every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine
   hand; and the land is subdued before the Lord, and before his people.

   ^19Now set your heart and your soul to seek the Lord your God; arise
   therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the Lord God, to bring the ark
   of the covenant of the Lord, and the holy vessels of God, into the
   house that is to be built to the name of the Lord.

    Chapter Chronicles 23

   So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king
   over Israel.

   ^2And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests
   and the Levites.

   ^3Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and
   upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and
   eight thousand.

   ^4Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of
   the house of the Lord; and six thousand were officers and judges:

   ^5Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the
   Lord with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise
   therewith.

   ^6And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely,
   Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

   ^7Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.

   ^8The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel,
   three.

   ^9The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These
   were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.

   ^10And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah.
   These four were the sons of Shimei.

   ^11And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah
   had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to
   their father's house.

   ^12The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

   ^13The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he
   should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn
   incense before the Lord, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name
   for ever.

   ^14Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the
   tribe of Levi.

   ^15The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.

   ^16Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.

   ^17And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had
   none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

   ^18Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.

   ^19Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,
   Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

   ^20Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first, and Jesiah the second.

   ^21The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar,
   and Kish.

   ^22And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren
   the sons of Kish took them.

   ^23The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.

   ^24These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even
   the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by
   their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the
   Lord, from the age of twenty years and upward.

   ^25For David said, The Lord God of Israel hath given rest unto his
   people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:

   ^26And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle,
   nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.

   ^27For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty
   years old and above:

   ^28Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the
   service of the house of the Lord, in the courts, and in the chambers,
   and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of
   the house of God;

   ^29Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering,
   and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan,
   and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size;

   ^30And to stand every morning to thank and praise the Lord, and
   likewise at even;

   ^31And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the Lord in the sabbaths, in
   the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order
   commanded unto them, continually before the Lord:

   ^32And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the
   congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the
   sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the Lord.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 24

   Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron;
   Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

   ^2But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children:
   therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office.

   ^3And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and
   Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their
   service.

   ^4And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of
   the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided. Among the sons of
   Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, and
   eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their
   fathers.

   ^5Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the
   governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of
   the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

   ^6And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites,
   wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and
   Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of
   the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for
   Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.

   ^7Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,

   ^8The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,

   ^9The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,

   ^10The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,

   ^11The ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,

   ^12The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,

   ^13The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,

   ^14The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,

   ^15The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses,

   ^16The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel,

   ^17The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul,

   ^18The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to
   Maaziah.

   ^19These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the
   house of the Lord, according to their manner, under Aaron their father,
   as the Lord God of Israel had commanded him.

   ^20And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of Amram;
   Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.

   ^21Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah.

   ^22Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.

   ^23And the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,
   Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.

   ^24Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir.

   ^25The brother of Michah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah;
   Zechariah.

   ^26The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno.

   ^27The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and
   Ibri.

   ^28Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.

   ^29Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.

   ^30The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were
   the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.

   ^31These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of
   Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and
   the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal
   fathers over against their younger brethren.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 25

   Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of
   the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy
   with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the
   workmen according to their service was:

   ^2Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and
   Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied
   according to the order of the king.

   ^3Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah,
   Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father

   Lord.

   ^4Of Heman: the sons of Heman; Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and
   Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-ezer,
   Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth:

   ^5All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God,
   to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three
   daughters.

   ^6All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house
   of the Lord, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of
   the house of God, according to the king's order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and
   Heman.

   ^7So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in
   the songs of the Lord, even all that were cunning, was two hundred
   fourscore and eight.

   ^8And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as the
   great, the teacher as the scholar.

   ^9Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to
   Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were twelve:

   ^10The third to Zaccur, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

   ^11The fourth to Izri, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

   ^12The fifth to Nethaniah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve:

    Chapter Chronicles 26

   Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the Korhites was
   Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.

   ^2And the sons of Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael
   the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,

   ^3Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Elioenai the seventh.

   ^4Moreover the sons of Obededom were, Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad
   the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethaneel the
   fifth,

   ^5Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth: for God
   blessed him.

   ^6Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled throughout the
   house of their father: for they were mighty men of valour.

   ^7The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose
   brethren were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.

   ^8All these of the sons of Obededom: they and their sons and their
   brethren, able men for strength for the service, were threescore and
   two of Obededom.

   ^9And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen.

   ^10Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the chief,
   (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him the
   chief;)

   ^11Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all
   the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen.

   ^12Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the chief
   men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the
   Lord.

   ^13And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the
   house of their fathers, for every gate.

   ^14And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son,
   a wise counsellor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward.

   ^15To Obed- edom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim.

   ^16To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the gate
   Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward against ward.

   ^17Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a
   day, and toward Asuppim two and two.

   ^18At Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.

   ^19These are the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore, and
   among the sons of Merari.

   ^20And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of
   God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things.

   ^21As concerning the sons of Laadan; the sons of the Gershonite Laadan,
   chief fathers, even of Laadan the Gershonite, were Jehieli.

   ^22The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel his brother, which were over
   the treasures of the house of the Lord.

   ^23Of the Amramites, and the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the
   Uzzielites:

   ^24And Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of the
   treasures.

   ^25And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son,
   and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son.

   ^26Which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the
   dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief fathers, the
   captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host, had
   dedicated.

   ^27Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the
   house of the Lord.

   ^28And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner
   the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; and
   whosoever had dedicated any thing, it was under the hand of Shelomith,
   and of his brethren.

   ^29Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward
   business over Israel, for officers and judges.

   ^30And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of valour, a
   thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them of Israel on this
   side Jordan westward in all the business of the Lord, and in the
   service of the king.

   ^31Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the
   Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers. In the
   fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there
   were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer of Gilead.

   ^32And his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven hundred
   chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the Reubenites, the
   Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to
   God, and affairs of the king.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 27

   Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the chief
   fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that
   served the king in any matter of the courses, which came in and went
   out month by month throughout all the months of the year, of every
   course were twenty and four thousand.

   ^2Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the son of
   Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

   ^3Of the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of the
   host for the first month.

   ^4And over the course of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite, and of
   his course was Mikloth also the ruler: in his course likewise were
   twenty and four thousand.

   ^5The third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah the son
   of Jehoiada, a chief priest: and in his course were twenty and four
   thousand.

   ^6This is that Benaiah, who was mighty among the thirty, and above the
   thirty: and in his course was Ammizabad his son.

   ^7The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of
   Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his course were twenty and
   four thousand.

   ^8The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and
   in his course were twenty and four thousand.

   ^9The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the
   Tekoite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

   ^10The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite, of
   the children of Ephraim: and in his course were twenty and four
   thousand.

   ^11The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the Hushathite,
   of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

   the Benjamites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

   ^13The tenth captain for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite,
   of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

   ^14The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the
   Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course were twenty
   and four thousand.

   ^15The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the
   Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and four
   thousand.

   ^16Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the Reubenites
   was Eliezer the son of Zichri: of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of
   Maachah:

   ^17Of the Levites, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of the Aaronites,
   Zadok:

   ^18Of Judah, Elihu, one of the brethren of David: of Issachar, Omri the
   son of Michael:

   ^19Of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah: of Naphtali, Jerimoth the

   ^21Of the half tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah:
   of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner:

   ^22Of Dan, PrAzareel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of the
   tribes of Israel.

   ^23But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and
   under: because the Lord had said he would increase Israel like to the
   stars of the heavens.

   ^24Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not,
   because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number
   put in the account of the chronicles of king David.

   ^25And over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and
   over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages,
   and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah:

   ^26And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the
   ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:

   ^27And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the increase
   of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite:

   ^28And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in the low
   plains was Baalhanan the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was
   Joash:

   ^29And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and
   over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai:

   ^30Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses was
   Jehdeiah the Meronothite:

   ^31And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite. All these were the
   rulers of the substance which was king David's.

   ^32Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and a
   scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons:

   ^33And Ahithophel was the king's counsellor: and Hushai the Archite was
   the king's companion:

   ^34And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar:
   and the general of the king's army was Joab.

    Chapter Chronicles 28

   And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the
   tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king
   by course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the
   hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the
   king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and
   with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem.

   ^2Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my
   brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an
   house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and for the
   footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building:

   ^3But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name,
   because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood.

   ^4Howbeit the Lord God of Israel chose me before all the house of my
   father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be
   the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among
   the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel:

   ^5And of all my sons, (for the Lord hath given me many sons,) he hath
   chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord
   over Israel.

   ^6And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my
   courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.

   ^7Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to
   do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.

   ^8Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the
   Lord, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the
   commandments of the Lord your God: that ye may possess this good land,
   and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.

   ^9And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve
   him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the Lord
   searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the
   thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou
   forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.

   ^10Take heed now; for the Lord hath chosen thee to build an house for
   the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.

   ^11Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of
   the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper
   chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place
   of the mercy seat,

   ^12And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of
   the house of the Lord, and of all the chambers round about, of the
   treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated
   things:

   ^13Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the
   work of the service of the house of the Lord, and for all the vessels
   of service in the house of the Lord.

   ^14He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of
   all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by
   weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:

   ^15Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of
   gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and
   for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and
   also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.

   ^16And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every
   table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:

   ^17Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and
   for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and
   likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver:

   ^18And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for
   the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their
   wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the Lord.

   ^19All this, said David, the Lord made me understand in writing by his
   hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.

   ^20And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage,
   and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the Lord God, even my God,
   will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou
   hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the Lord.

   ^21And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they
   shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there
   shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful
   man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people
   will be wholly at thy commandment.

    Chapter Chronicles 29

   Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my
   son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work
   is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the Lord God.

   ^2Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the
   gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of
   silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron,
   and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set,
   glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious
   stones, and marble stones in abundance.

   ^3Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I
   have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to
   the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the
   holy house,

   ^4Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven
   thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses
   withal:

   ^5The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and
   for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who
   then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the Lord?

   ^6Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel,
   and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the
   king's work, offered willingly,

   ^7And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand
   talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and
   of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of
   iron.

   ^8And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the
   treasure of the house of the Lord, by the hand of Jehiel the
   Gershonite.

   ^9Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because
   with perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord: and David the
   king also rejoiced with great joy.

   ^10Wherefore David blessed the Lord before all the congregation: and
   David said, Blessed be thou, Lord God of Israel our father, for ever
   and ever.

   ^11Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and
   the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the
   earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as
   head above all.

   ^12Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and
   in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make
   great, and to give strength unto all.

   ^13Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.

   ^14But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer
   so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine
   own have we given thee.

   ^15For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our
   fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none
   abiding.

   ^16O Lord our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee
   an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine
   own.

   ^17I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure
   in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have
   willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy
   people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.

   ^18O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this
   for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people,
   and prepare their heart unto thee:

   ^19And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy
   commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these
   things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.

   ^20And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the Lord your God.
   And all the congregation blessed the Lord God of their fathers, and
   bowed down their heads, and worshipped the Lord, and the king.

   ^21And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the Lord, and offered burnt
   offerings unto the Lord, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand
   bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink
   offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:

   ^22And did eat and drink before the Lord on that day with great
   gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time,
   and anointed him unto the Lord to be the chief governor, and Zadok to
   be priest.

   ^23Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David
   his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.

   ^24And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise
   of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.

   ^25And the Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all
   Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any
   king before him in Israel.

   ^26Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.

   ^27And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven
   years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in
   Jerusalem.

   ^28And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and
   Solomon his son reigned in his stead.

   ^29Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are
   written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the
   prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,

   ^30With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him,
   and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.

    Chapter Chronicles 1

   And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the
   Lord his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.

   ^2Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and
   of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel,
   the chief of the fathers.

   ^3So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place
   that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of
   God, which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness.

   ^4But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the
   place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it
   at Jerusalem.

   ^5Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of
   Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the Lord: and Solomon
   and the congregation sought unto it.

   ^6And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the Lord,
   which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand
   burnt offerings upon it.

   ^7In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask
   what I shall give thee.

   ^8And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my
   father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.

   ^9Now, O Lord God, let thy promise unto David my father be established:
   for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in
   multitude.

   ^10Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in
   before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so
   great?

   ^11And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou
   hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine
   enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and
   knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I
   have made thee king:

   ^12Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee
   riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that
   have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the
   like.

   ^13Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at
   Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation,
   and reigned over Israel.

   ^14And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand
   and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he
   placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.

   ^15And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as
   stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the
   vale for abundance.

   ^16And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the
   king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

   ^17And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for
   six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty:
   and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and
   for the kings of Syria, by their means.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 2

   And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the Lord, and
   an house for his kingdom.

   ^2And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens,
   and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and
   six hundred to oversee them.

   ^3And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst
   deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an
   house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.

   ^4Behold, I build an house to the name of the Lord my God, to dedicate
   it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual
   shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the
   sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the Lord
   our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.

   ^5And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above all
   gods.

   ^6But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven
   of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I should build him
   an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him?

   ^7Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver,
   and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and
   that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in Judah
   and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide.

   ^8Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon:
   for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and,
   behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,

   ^9Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am
   about to build shall be wonderful great.

   ^10And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut
   timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand
   measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty
   thousand baths of oil.

   ^11Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to
   Solomon, Because the Lord hath loved his people, he hath made thee king
   over them.

   ^12Huram said moreover, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, that made
   heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued
   with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the
   Lord, and an house for his kingdom.

   ^13And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of
   Huram my father's,

   ^14The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man
   of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in
   stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in
   crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every
   device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the
   cunning men of my lord David thy father.

   ^15Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine,
   which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants:

   ^16And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and
   we will bring it to thee in flotes by sea to Joppa; and thou shall
   carry it up to Jerusalem.

   ^17And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of
   Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered
   them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three
   thousand and six hundred.

   ^18And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of
   burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three
   thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 3

   Then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem in mount
   Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father, in the place
   that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

   ^2And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the
   fourth year of his reign.

   ^3Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the
   building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first
   measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.

   ^4And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it
   was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the
   height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure
   gold.

   ^5And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with
   fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.

   ^6And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the
   gold was gold of Parvaim.

   ^7He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls
   thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the
   walls.

   ^8And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was according to
   the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty
   cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred
   talents.

   ^9And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he
   overlaid the upper chambers with gold.

   ^10And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and
   overlaid them with gold.

   ^11And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing of
   the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and
   the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the
   other cherub.

   ^12And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the
   wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to
   the wing of the other cherub.

   ^13The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits:
   and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.

   ^14And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine
   linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.

   ^15Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits
   high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five
   cubits.

   ^16And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of
   the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the
   chains.

   ^17And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right
   hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the
   right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 4

   Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof,
   and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height
   thereof.

   ^2Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in
   compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty
   cubits did compass it round about.

   ^3And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round
   about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen
   were cast, when it was cast.

   ^4It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three
   looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three
   looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all
   their hinder parts were inward.

   ^5And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like
   the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received
   and held three thousand baths.

   ^6He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on
   the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt
   offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash
   in.

   ^7And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set
   them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.

   ^8He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the
   right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of
   gold.

   ^9Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court,
   and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.

   ^10And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against
   the south.

   ^11And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram
   finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of
   God;

   ^12To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters which
   were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the
   two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars;

   ^13And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of
   pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters
   which were upon the pillars.

   ^14He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;

   ^15One sea, and twelve oxen under it.

   ^16The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their
   instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of
   the Lord of bright brass.

   ^17In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground
   between Succoth and Zeredathah.

   ^18Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the
   weight of the brass could not be found out.

   ^19And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the
   golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set;

   ^20Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn
   after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;

   ^21And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and
   that perfect gold;

   ^22And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers,
   of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for
   the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of
   gold.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 5

   Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the Lord was
   finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father
   had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments,
   put he among the treasures of the house of God.

   ^2Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the
   tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto
   Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the
   city of David, which is Zion.

   ^3Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in
   the feast which was in the seventh month.

   ^4And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.

   ^5And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation,
   and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the
   priests and the Levites bring up.

   ^6Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were
   assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which
   could not be told nor numbered for multitude.

   ^7And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord unto
   his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even
   under the wings of the cherubims:

   ^8For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark,
   and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.

   ^9And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves
   were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen
   without. And there it is unto this day.

   ^10There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put
   therein at Horeb, when the Lord made a covenant with the children of
   Israel, when they came out of Egypt.

   ^11And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
   place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did
   not then wait by course:

   ^12Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of
   Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed
   in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the
   east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests
   sounding with trumpets:)

   ^13It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to
   make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the Lord; and when
   they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and
   instruments of musick, and praised the Lord, saying, For he is good;
   for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a
   cloud, even the house of the Lord;

   ^14So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the
   cloud: for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God.

    Chapter Chronicles 6

   Then said Solomon, The Lord hath said that he would dwell in the thick
   darkness.

   ^2But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy
   dwelling for ever.

   ^3And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of
   Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood.

   ^4And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who hath with his
   hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David,
   saying,

   ^5Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt
   I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in,
   that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over
   my people Israel:

   ^6But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have
   chosen David to be over my people Israel.

   ^7Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the
   name of the Lord God of Israel.

   ^8But the Lord said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine
   heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in
   thine heart:

   ^9Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which
   shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my
   name.

   ^10The Lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for
   I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne
   of Israel, as the Lord promised, and have built the house for the name
   of the Lord God of Israel.

   ^11And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the Lord,
   that he made with the children of Israel.

   ^12And he stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the
   congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:

   ^13For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long, and
   five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst
   of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees
   before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands
   toward heaven,

   ^14And said, O Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in the
   heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and shewest mercy
   unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:

   ^15Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which
   thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled
   it with thine hand, as it is this day.

   ^16Now therefore, O Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my
   father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail
   thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that
   thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast
   walked before me.

   ^17Now then, O Lord God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou
   hast spoken unto thy servant David.

   ^18But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold,
   heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less
   this house which I have built!

   ^19Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his
   supplication, O Lord my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer
   which thy servant prayeth before thee:

   ^20That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the
   place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to
   hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place.

   ^21Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy
   people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from
   thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.

   ^22If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to
   make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house;

   ^23Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by
   requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by
   justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.

   ^24And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy,
   because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy
   name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house;

   ^25Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people
   Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them
   and to their fathers.

   ^26When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have
   sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place, and confess
   thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them;

   ^27Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and
   of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein
   they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given
   unto thy people for an inheritance.

   ^28If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be
   blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if their enemies besiege
   them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever
   sickness there be:

   ^29Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any
   man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall know his own
   sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth his hands in this house:

   ^30Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and
   render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose heart thou
   knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:)

   ^31That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live
   in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.

   ^32Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel,
   but is come from a far country for thy great name's sake, and thy
   mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this
   house;

   ^33Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, and
   do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all
   people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy
   people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is
   called by thy name.

   ^34If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that
   thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which
   thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name;

   ^35Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication,
   and maintain their cause.

   ^36If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not,)
   and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their
   enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near;

   ^37Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried
   captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity,
   saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;

   ^38If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul
   in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them
   captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their
   fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the
   house which I have built for thy name:

   ^39Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their
   prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive
   thy people which have sinned against thee.

   ^40Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine
   ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place.

   ^41Now therefore arise, O Lord God, into thy resting place, thou, and
   the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O Lord God, be clothed with
   salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in goodness.

   ^42O Lord God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the
   mercies of David thy servant.

    Chapter Chronicles 7

   Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from
   heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the
   glory of the Lord filled the house.

   ^2And the priests could not enter into the house of the Lord, because
   the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord'S house.

   ^3And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and
   the glory of the Lord upon the house, they bowed themselves with their
   faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the
   Lord, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.

   ^4Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the Lord.

   ^5And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen,
   and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the
   people dedicated the house of God.

   ^6And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with
   instruments of musick of the Lord, which David the king had made to
   praise the Lord, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David
   praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before
   them, and all Israel stood.

   ^7Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the
   house of the Lord: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of
   the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made
   was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings,
   and the fat.

   ^8Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all
   Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of
   Hamath unto the river of Egypt.

   ^9And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the
   dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.

   ^10And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the
   people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness
   that the Lord had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his
   people.

   ^11Thus Solomon finished the house of the Lord, and the king's house:
   and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the
   Lord, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.

   ^12And the Lord appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have
   heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of
   sacrifice.

   ^13If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the
   locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;

   ^14If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves,
   and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will
   I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their
   land.

   ^15Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer
   that is made in this place.

   ^16For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be
   there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there
   perpetually.

   ^17And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father
   walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt
   observe my statutes and my judgments;

   ^18Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have
   covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a
   man to be ruler in Israel.

   ^19But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments,
   which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and
   worship them;

   ^20Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have
   given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I
   cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword
   among all nations.

   ^21And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one
   that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the Lord done thus
   unto this land, and unto this house?

   ^22And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the Lord God of their
   fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid
   hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore
   hath he brought all this evil upon them.

    Chapter Chronicles 8

   And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had
   built the house of the Lord, and his own house,

   ^2That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built
   them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.

   ^3And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.

   ^4And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities,
   which he built in Hamath.

   ^5Also he built Beth- horon the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced
   cities, with walls, gates, and bars;

   ^6And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the
   chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon
   desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the
   land of his dominion.

   ^7As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the
   Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which
   were not of Israel,

   ^8But of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the
   children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute
   until this day.

   ^9But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his
   work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains
   of his chariots and horsemen.

   ^10And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two
   hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.

   ^11And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of
   David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife
   shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the
   places are holy, whereunto the ark of the Lord hath come.

   ^12Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the Lord on the altar of
   the Lord, which he had built before the porch,

   ^13Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the
   commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the
   solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened
   bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.

   ^14And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the
   courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their
   charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of
   every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate:
   for so had David the man of God commanded.

   ^15And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the
   priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.

   ^16Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the
   foundation of the house of the Lord, and until it was finished. So the
   house of the Lord was perfected.

   ^17Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in
   the land of Edom.

   ^18And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants
   that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of
   Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of
   gold, and brought them to king Solomon.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 9

   And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to
   prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great
   company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and
   precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with
   him of all that was in her heart.

   ^2And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid
   from Solomon which he told her not.

   ^3And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the
   house that he had built,

   ^4And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the
   attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also,
   and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of
   the Lord; there was no more spirit in her.

   ^5And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in mine
   own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:

   ^6Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had
   seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was
   not told me: for thou exceedest the fame that I heard.

   ^7Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which stand
   continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.

   ^8Blessed be the Lord thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on
   his throne, to be king for the Lord thy God: because thy God loved
   Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over
   them, to do judgment and justice.

   ^9And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of
   spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such
   spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.

   ^10And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which
   brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.

   ^11And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the
   Lord, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers:
   and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.

   ^12And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
   whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king.
   So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.

   ^13Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six
   hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;

   ^14Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings
   of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to
   Solomon.

   ^15And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
   hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.

   ^16And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred
   shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house
   of the forest of Lebanon.

   ^17Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with
   pure gold.

   ^18And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold,
   which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the
   sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays:

   ^19And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon
   the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.

   ^20And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and all
   the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold:
   none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of
   Solomon.

   ^21For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram:
   every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and
   silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

   ^22And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and
   wisdom.

   ^23And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to
   hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.

   ^24And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
   vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a
   rate year by year.

   ^25And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and
   twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and
   with the king at Jerusalem.

   ^26And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land
   of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.

   ^27And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees
   made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance.

   ^28And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all
   lands.

   ^29Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not
   written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of
   Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against
   Jeroboam the son of Nebat?

   ^30And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.

   ^31And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of
   David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 10

   And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to
   make him king.

   ^2And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in
   Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard
   it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.

   ^3And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and
   spake to Rehoboam, saying,

   ^4Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat
   the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put
   upon us, and we will serve thee.

   ^5And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the
   people departed.

   ^6And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before
   Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me
   to return answer to this people?

   ^7And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and
   please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants
   for ever.

   ^8But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took
   counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood
   before him.

   ^9And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer
   to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke
   that thy father did put upon us?

   ^10And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him,
   saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying,
   Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for
   us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker
   than my father's loins.

   ^11For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to
   your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you
   with scorpions.

   ^12So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as
   the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day.

   ^13And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the
   counsel of the old men,

   ^14And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My
   father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father
   chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

   ^15So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God,
   that the Lord might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of
   Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

   ^16And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them,
   the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David?
   and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your
   tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to thine own house. So all Israel
   went to their tents.

   ^17But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah,
   Rehoboam reigned over them.

   ^18Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the
   children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king
   Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.

   ^19And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 11

   And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of
   Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which
   were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom
   again to Rehoboam.

   ^2But the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,

   ^3Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all
   Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,

   ^4Thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your
   brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me.
   And they obeyed the words of the Lord, and returned from going against
   Jeroboam.

   ^5And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in
   Judah.

   ^6He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,

   ^7And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,

   ^8And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,

   ^9And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,

   ^10And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in
   Benjamin fenced cities.

   ^11And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and
   store of victual, and of oil and wine.

   ^12And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them
   exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.

   ^13And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to
   him out of all their coasts.

   ^14For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to
   Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from
   executing the priest's office unto the Lord:

   ^15And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils,
   and for the calves which he had made.

   ^16And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their
   hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice
   unto the Lord God of their fathers.

   ^17So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son
   of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way
   of David and Solomon.

   ^18And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of
   David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse;

   ^19Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.

   ^20And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare
   him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.

   ^21And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his
   wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore
   concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.)

   ^22And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be ruler
   among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.

   ^23And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout
   all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he
   gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 12

   And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had
   strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the Lord, and all Israel
   with him.

   ^2And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak
   king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed
   against the Lord,

   ^3With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and
   the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the
   Lubim, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.

   ^4And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to
   Jerusalem.

   ^5Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of
   Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and
   said unto them, Thus saith the Lord, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore
   have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.

   ^6Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and
   they said, The Lord is righteous.

   ^7And when the Lord saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the
   Lord came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore
   I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my
   wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.

   ^8Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my
   service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.

   ^9So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the
   treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's
   house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which
   Solomon had made.

   ^10Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed
   them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of
   the king's house.

   ^11And when the king entered into the house of the Lord, the guard came
   and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.

   ^12And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord turned from him
   that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went
   well.

   ^13So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for
   Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he
   reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord had
   chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his
   mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.

   ^14And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the Lord.

   ^15Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in
   the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning
   genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam
   continually.

   ^16And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
   David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 13

   Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over
   Judah.

   ^2He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was
   Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between
   Abijah and Jeroboam.

   ^3And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of
   war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the
   battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men,
   being mighty men of valour.

   ^4And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim,
   and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;

   ^5Ought ye not to know that the Lord God of Israel gave the kingdom
   over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a
   covenant of salt?

   ^6Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of
   David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.

   ^7And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and
   have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when
   Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.

   ^8And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the Lord in the hand of
   the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with you
   golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods.

   ^9Have ye not cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons of Aaron, and
   the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations
   of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a
   young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are
   no gods.

   ^10But as for us, the Lord is our God, and we have not forsaken him;
   and the priests, which minister unto the Lord, are the sons of Aaron,
   and the Levites wait upon their business:

   ^11And they burn unto the Lord every morning and every evening burnt
   sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon
   the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to
   burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the Lord our God; but ye
   have forsaken him.

   ^12And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests
   with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel,
   fight ye not against the Lord God of your fathers; for ye shall not
   prosper.

   ^13But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they
   were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.

   ^14And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and
   behind: and they cried unto the Lord, and the priests sounded with the
   trumpets.

   ^15Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted,
   it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah
   and Judah.

   ^16And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them
   into their hand.

   ^17And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there
   fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.

   ^18Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the
   children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the Lord God of
   their fathers.

   ^19And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel
   with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and
   Ephrain with the towns thereof.

   ^20Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah:
   and the Lord struck him, and he died.

   ^21But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat
   twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.

   ^22And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings,
   are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.

    Chapter Chronicles 14

   So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of
   David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was
   quiet ten years.

   ^2And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the Lord his
   God:

   ^3For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places,
   and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:

   ^4And commanded Judah to seek the Lord God of their fathers, and to do
   the law and the commandment.

   ^5Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and
   the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.

   ^6And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he
   had no war in those years; because the Lord had given him rest.

   ^7Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make
   about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet
   before us; because we have sought the Lord our God, we have sought him,
   and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.

   ^8And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah
   three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew
   bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of
   valour.

   ^9And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a
   thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.

   ^10Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in
   the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.

   ^11And Asa cried unto the Lord his God, and said, Lord, it is nothing
   with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power:
   help us, O Lord our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go
   against this multitude. O Lord, thou art our God; let not man prevail
   against thee.

   ^12So the Lord smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and
   the Ethiopians fled.

   ^13And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar:
   and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover
   themselves; for they were destroyed before the Lord, and before his
   host; and they carried away very much spoil.

   ^14And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the
   Lord came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was
   exceeding much spoil in them.

   ^15They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and
   camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 15

   And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:

   ^2And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and
   all Judah and Benjamin; The Lord is with you, while ye be with him; and
   if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will
   forsake you.

   ^3Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and
   without a teaching priest, and without law.

   ^4But when they in their trouble did turn unto the Lord God of Israel,
   and sought him, he was found of them.

   ^5And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to
   him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of
   the countries.

   ^6And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex
   them with all adversity.

   ^7Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work
   shall be rewarded.

   ^8And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet,
   he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land
   of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from
   mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the Lord, that was before the
   porch of the Lord.

   ^9And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them
   out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him
   out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the Lord his God was
   with him.

   ^10So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third
   month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.

   ^11And they offered unto the Lord the same time, of the spoil which
   they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.

   ^12And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their
   fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;

   ^13That whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put
   to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.

   ^14And they sware unto the Lord with a loud voice, and with shouting,
   and with trumpets, and with cornets.

   ^15And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all
   their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found
   of them: and the Lord gave them rest round about.

   ^16And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed
   her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa
   cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.

   ^17But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless
   the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.

   ^18And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had
   dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and
   vessels.

   ^19And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the
   reign of Asa.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 16

   In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel
   came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let
   none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.

   ^2Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the
   house of the Lord and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of
   Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,

   ^3There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father
   and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy
   league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.

   ^4And Ben- hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his
   armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and
   Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.

   ^5And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building
   of Ramah, and let his work cease.

   ^6Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of
   Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he
   built therewith Geba and Mizpah.

   ^7And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said
   unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied
   on the Lord thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped
   out of thine hand.

   ^8Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many
   chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the Lord, he
   delivered them into thine hand.

   ^9For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth,
   to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect
   toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth
   thou shalt have wars.

   ^10Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for
   he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some
   of the people the same time.

   ^11And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written
   in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

   ^12And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in
   his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he
   sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians.

   ^13And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth
   year of his reign.

   ^14And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for
   himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled
   with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the
   apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 17

   And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself
   against Israel.

   ^2And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set
   garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa
   his father had taken.

   ^3And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first
   ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;

   ^4But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his
   commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.

   ^5Therefore the Lord stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah
   brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in
   abundance.

   ^6And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord: moreover he took
   away the high places and groves out of Judah.

   ^7Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to
   Ben-hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to
   Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.

   ^8And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and
   Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah,
   and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and
   Jehoram, priests.

   ^9And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the Lord
   with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and
   taught the people.

   ^10And the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands
   that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against
   Jehoshaphat.

   ^11Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and
   tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and
   seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats.

   ^12And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah
   castles, and cities of store.

   ^13And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war,
   mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem.

   ^14And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their
   fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with
   him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand.

   ^15And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred
   and fourscore thousand.

   ^16And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered
   himself unto the Lord; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of
   valour.

   ^17And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed
   men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.

   ^18And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore
   thousand ready prepared for the war.

   ^19These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the
   fenced cities throughout all Judah.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 18

   Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity
   with Ahab.

   ^2And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab
   killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he
   had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.

   ^3And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt
   thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art,
   and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.

   ^4And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee,
   at the word of the Lord to day.

   ^5Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four
   hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle,
   or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into
   the king's hand.

   ^6But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord
   besides, that we might enquire of him?

   ^7And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man,
   by whom we may enquire of the Lord: but I hate him; for he never
   prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son
   of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.

   ^8And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and said,
   Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.

   ^9And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of
   them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void
   place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets
   prophesied before them.

   ^10And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and
   said, Thus saith the Lord, With these thou shalt push Syria until they
   be consumed.

   ^11And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead,
   and prosper: for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.

   ^12And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying,
   Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one
   assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and
   speak thou good.

   ^13And Micaiah said, As the Lord liveth, even what my God saith, that
   will I speak.

   ^14And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah,
   shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said,
   Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.

   ^15And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that
   thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the Lord?

   ^16Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as
   sheep that have no shepherd: and the Lord said, These have no master;
   let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.

   ^17And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that
   he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?

   ^18Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the Lord; I saw the Lord
   sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his
   right hand and on his left.

   ^19And the Lord said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may
   go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner,
   and another saying after that manner.

   ^20Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said, I
   will entice him. And the Lord said unto him, Wherewith?

   ^21And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of
   all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou
   shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.

   ^22Now therefore, behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth
   of these thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil against thee.

   ^23Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon
   the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to
   speak unto thee?

   ^24And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt
   go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

   ^25Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to
   Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;

   ^26And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and
   feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I
   return in peace.

   ^27And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not
   the Lord spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people.

   ^28So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to
   Ramothgilead.

   ^29And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
   myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the
   king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle.

   ^30Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots
   that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only
   with the king of Israel.

   ^31And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
   Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they
   compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord
   helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.

   ^32For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots
   perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again
   from pursuing him.

   ^33And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of
   Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his
   chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the
   host; for I am wounded.

   ^34And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed
   himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about
   the time of the sun going down he died.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 19

   And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to
   Jerusalem.

   ^2And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to
   king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that
   hate the Lord? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord.

   ^3Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast
   taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to
   seek God.

   ^4And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the
   people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the
   Lord God of their fathers.

   ^5And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of
   Judah, city by city,

   ^6And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for
   man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment.

   ^7Wherefore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you; take heed and do
   it: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor respect of
   persons, nor taking of gifts.

   ^8Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the
   priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of
   the Lord, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem.

   ^9And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the
   Lord, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.

   ^10And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell
   in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment,
   statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not
   against the Lord, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren:
   this do, and ye shall not trespass.

   ^11And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of
   the Lord; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of
   Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officers
   before you. Deal courageously, and the Lord shall be with the good.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 20

   It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab, and the
   children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came
   against Jehoshaphat to battle.

   ^2Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a
   great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria;
   and, behold, they be Hazazon-tamar, which is Engedi.

   ^3And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the Lord, and
   proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.

   ^4And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the Lord: even
   out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord.

   ^5And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in
   the house of the Lord, before the new court,

   ^6And said, O Lord God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and
   rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand
   is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?

   ^7Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this
   land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy
   friend for ever?

   ^8And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for
   thy name, saying,

   ^9If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence,
   or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy
   name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou
   wilt hear and help.

   ^10And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom
   thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of
   Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not;

   ^11Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy
   possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.

   ^12O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against
   this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do:
   but our eyes are upon thee.

   ^13And all Judah stood before the Lord, with their little ones, their
   wives, and their children.

   ^14Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son
   of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the
   Spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation;

   ^15And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem,
   and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the Lord unto you, Be not afraid
   nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not
   yours, but God's.

   ^16To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff
   of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the
   wilderness of Jeruel.

   ^17Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye
   still, and see the salvation of the Lord with you, O Judah and
   Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them:
   for the Lord will be with you.

   ^18And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all
   Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the Lord,
   worshipping the Lord.

   ^19And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the
   children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel
   with a loud voice on high.

   ^20And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the
   wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and
   said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the
   Lord your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so
   shall ye prosper.

   ^21And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto
   the Lord, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went
   out before the army, and to say, Praise the Lord; for his mercy
   endureth for ever.

   ^22And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments
   against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come
   against Judah; and they were smitten.

   ^23For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants
   of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made
   an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.

   ^24And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they
   looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to
   the earth, and none escaped.

   ^25And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of
   them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead
   bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves,
   more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering
   of the spoil, it was so much.

   ^26And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of
   Berachah; for there they blessed the Lord: therefore the name of the
   same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.

   ^27Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and
   Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with
   joy; for the Lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies.

   ^28And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets
   unto the house of the Lord.

   ^29And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when
   they had heard that the Lord fought against the enemies of Israel.

   ^30So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest
   round about.

   ^31And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old
   when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in
   Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.

   ^32And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from
   it, doing that which was right in the sight of the Lord.

   ^33Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people
   had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.

   ^34Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold,
   they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is
   mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.

   ^35And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with
   Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:

   ^36And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and
   they made the ships in Eziongaber.

   ^37Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against
   Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the
   Lord hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were
   not able to go to Tarshish.

    Chapter Chronicles 21

   Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
   in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.

   ^2And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and
   Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the
   sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.

   ^3And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of
   precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he
   to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.

   ^4Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he
   strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and
   divers also of the princes of Israel.

   ^5Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he
   reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

   ^6And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the
   house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought
   that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord.

   ^7Howbeit the Lord would not destroy the house of David, because of the
   covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a
   light to him and to his sons for ever.

   ^8In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah,
   and made themselves a king.

   ^9Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with
   him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed
   him in, and the captains of the chariots.

   ^10So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.
   The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he
   had forsaken the Lord God of his fathers.

   ^11Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused
   the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah
   thereto.

   ^12And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying,
   Thus saith the Lord God of David thy father, Because thou hast not
   walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa
   king of Judah,

   ^13But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made
   Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the
   whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy
   father's house, which were better than thyself:

   ^14Behold, with a great plague will the Lord smite thy people, and thy
   children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:

   ^15And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until
   thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.

   ^16Moreover the Lord stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the
   Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:

   ^17And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all
   the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also,
   and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz,
   the youngest of his sons.

   ^18And after all this the Lord smote him in his bowels with an
   incurable disease.

   ^19And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two
   years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of
   sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning
   of his fathers.

   ^20Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he
   reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired.
   Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres
   of the kings.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 22

   And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in
   his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp
   had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah
   reigned.

   ^2Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he
   reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah the
   daughter of Omri.

   ^3He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was
   his counsellor to do wickedly.

   ^4Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the Lord like the house of
   Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to
   his destruction.

   ^5He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of
   Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at
   Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.

   ^6And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which
   were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And
   Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the
   son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.

   ^7And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for
   when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of
   Nimshi, whom the Lord had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.

   ^8And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the
   house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the
   brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.

   ^9And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in
   Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they
   buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who
   sought the Lord with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no
   power to keep still the kingdom.

   ^10But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead,
   she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah.

   ^11But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of
   Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and
   put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of
   king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister
   of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.

   ^12And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah
   reigned over the land.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 23

   And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the
   captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son
   of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of
   Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.

   ^2And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the
   cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came
   to Jerusalem.

   ^3And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house
   of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as
   the Lord hath said of the sons of David.

   ^4This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on
   the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the
   doors;

   ^5And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third part at
   the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts
   of the house of the Lord.

   ^6But let none come into the house of the Lord, save the priests, and
   they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy:
   but all the people shall keep the watch of the Lord.

   ^7And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with
   his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house, he
   shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and
   when he goeth out.

   ^8So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that
   Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were
   to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the
   sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.

   ^9Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds
   spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which
   were in the house of God.

   ^10And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand,
   from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along
   by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.

   ^11Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown,
   and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his
   sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.

   ^12Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising
   the king, she came to the people into the house of the Lord:

   ^13And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the
   entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the
   people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the
   singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise.
   Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.

   ^14Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that
   were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the
   ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For
   the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the Lord.

   ^15So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of
   the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there.

   ^16And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the
   people, and between the king, that they should be the Lord'S people.

   ^17Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down,
   and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the
   priest of Baal before the altars.

   ^18Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the Lord by the
   hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the
   house of the Lord, to offer the burnt offerings of the Lord, as it is
   written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was
   ordained by David.

   ^19And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the Lord, that
   none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.

   ^20And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the
   governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought
   down the king from the house of the Lord: and they came through the
   high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of
   the kingdom.

   ^21And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet,
   after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 24

   Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty
   years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Zibiah of Beersheba.

   ^2And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all the
   days of Jehoiada the priest.

   ^3And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.

   ^4And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the
   house of the Lord.

   ^5And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to
   them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money
   to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye
   hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.

   ^6And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why
   hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out
   of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the
   servant of the Lord, and of the congregation of Israel, for the
   tabernacle of witness?

   ^7For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house
   of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord did
   they bestow upon Baalim.

   ^8And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without
   at the gate of the house of the Lord.

   ^9And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in
   to the Lord the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon
   Israel in the wilderness.

   ^10And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and
   cast into the chest, until they had made an end.

   ^11Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto
   the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that
   there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer
   came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place
   again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.

   ^12And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the
   service of the house of the Lord, and hired masons and carpenters to
   repair the house of the Lord, and also such as wrought iron and brass
   to mend the house of the Lord.

   ^13So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they
   set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.

   ^14And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money
   before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house
   of the Lord, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons,
   and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the
   house of the Lord continually all the days of Jehoiada.

   ^15But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an
   hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.

   ^16And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he
   had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.

   ^17Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made
   obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.

   ^18And they left the house of the Lord God of their fathers, and served
   groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this
   their trespass.

   ^19Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the Lord; and
   they testified against them: but they would not give ear.

   ^20And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the
   priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith
   God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the Lord, that ye cannot
   prosper? because ye have forsaken the Lord, he hath also forsaken you.

   ^21And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the
   commandment of the king in the court of the house of the Lord.

   ^22Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his
   father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said,
   The Lord look upon it, and require it.

   ^23And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria
   came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and
   destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent
   all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.

   ^24For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and
   the Lord delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had
   forsaken the Lord God of their fathers. So they executed judgment
   against Joash.

   ^25And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great
   diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the
   sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and
   they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the
   sepulchres of the kings.

   ^26And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of
   Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.

   ^27Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon
   him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in
   the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his
   stead.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 25

   Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he
   reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
   Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

   ^2And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not
   with a perfect heart.

   ^3Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he
   slew his servants that had killed the king his father.

   ^4But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law
   in the book of Moses, where the Lord commanded, saying, The fathers
   shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the
   fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.

   ^5Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over
   thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their
   fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from
   twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand
   choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and
   shield.

   ^6He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel
   for an hundred talents of silver.

   ^7But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army
   of Israel go with thee; for the Lord is not with Israel, to wit, with
   all the children of Ephraim.

   ^8But if thou wilt go, do it, be strong for the battle: God shall make
   thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast
   down.

   ^9And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the
   hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man
   of God answered, The Lord is able to give thee much more than this.

   ^10Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him
   out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly
   kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.

   ^11And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went
   to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand.

   ^12And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry
   away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them
   down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.

   ^13But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they
   should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from
   Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took
   much spoil.

   ^14Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter
   of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and
   set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and
   burned incense unto them.

   ^15Wherefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against Amaziah, and he
   sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought
   after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people
   out of thine hand?

   ^16And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto
   him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou
   be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath
   determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not
   hearkened unto my counsel.

   ^17Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son
   of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see
   one another in the face.

   ^18And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The
   thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon,
   saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild
   beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.

   ^19Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart
   lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle
   to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with
   thee?

   ^20But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might
   deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after
   the gods of Edom.

   ^21So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the
   face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth- shemesh, which
   belongeth to Judah.

   ^22And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every
   man to his tent.

   ^23And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of
   Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to
   Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of
   Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

   ^24And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that
   were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the
   king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.

   ^25And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of
   Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.

   ^26Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are
   they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?

   ^27Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the
   Lord they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to
   Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.

   ^28And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in
   the city of Judah.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 26

   Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old,
   and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.

   ^2He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept
   with his fathers.

   ^3Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned
   fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jecoliah
   of Jerusalem.

   ^4And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according
   to all that his father Amaziah did.

   ^5And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in
   the visions of God: and as long as he sought the Lord, God made him to
   prosper.

   ^6And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down
   the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and
   built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.

   ^7And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians
   that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Mehunims.

   ^8And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad
   even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself
   exceedingly.

   ^9Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at
   the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.

   ^10Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he
   had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen
   also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved
   husbandry.

   ^11Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by
   bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel
   the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of
   the king's captains.

   ^12The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of
   valour were two thousand and six hundred.

   ^13And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven
   thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the
   king against the enemy.

   ^14And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and
   spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast
   stones.

   ^15And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on
   the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones
   withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped,
   till he was strong.

   ^16But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction:
   for he transgressed against the Lord his God, and went into the temple
   of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense.

   ^17And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore
   priests of the Lord, that were valiant men:

   ^18And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It
   appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the Lord, but
   to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense:
   go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be
   for thine honour from the Lord God.

   ^19Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense:
   and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in
   his forehead before the priests in the house of the Lord, from beside
   the incense altar.

   ^20And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him,
   and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out
   from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the Lord had
   smitten him.

   ^21And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt
   in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of
   the Lord: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the
   people of the land.

   ^22Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the
   prophet, the son of Amoz, write.

   ^23So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his
   fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for
   they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 27

   Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he
   reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was
   Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.

   ^2And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according
   to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not into the
   temple of the Lord. And the people did yet corruptly.

   ^3He built the high gate of the house of the Lord, and on the wall of
   Ophel he built much.

   ^4Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the
   forests he built castles and towers.

   ^5He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against
   them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred
   talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand
   of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the
   second year, and the third.

   ^6So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the Lord
   his God.

   ^7Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways,
   lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

   ^8He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned
   sixteen years in Jerusalem.

   ^9And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of
   David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

    Chapter Chronicles 28

   Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
   sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the
   sight of the Lord, like David his father:

   ^2For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also
   molten images for Baalim.

   ^3Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and
   burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen
   whom the Lord had cast out before the children of Israel.

   ^4He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the
   hills, and under every green tree.

   ^5Wherefore the Lord his God delivered him into the hand of the king of
   Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them
   captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into
   the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.

   ^6For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty
   thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had
   forsaken the Lord God of their fathers.

   ^7And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son,
   and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the
   king.

   ^8And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two
   hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much
   spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.

   ^9But a prophet of the Lord was there, whose name was Oded: and he went
   out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold,
   because the Lord God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath
   delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that
   reacheth up unto heaven.

   ^10And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem
   for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even
   with you, sins against the Lord your God?

   ^11Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have
   taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the Lord is
   upon you.

   ^12Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the
   son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the
   son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that
   came from the war,

   ^13And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for
   whereas we have offended against the Lord already, ye intend to add
   more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and
   there is fierce wrath against Israel.

   ^14So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes
   and all the congregation.

   ^15And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the
   captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them,
   and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and
   anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and
   brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren:
   then they returned to Samaria.

   ^16At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help
   him.

   ^17For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away
   captives.

   ^18The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and
   of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and
   Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the
   villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt
   there.

   ^19For the Lord brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for
   he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the Lord.

   ^20And Tilgath- pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed
   him, but strengthened him not.

   ^21For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the Lord, and out
   of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king
   of Assyria: but he helped him not.

   ^22And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the
   Lord: this is that king Ahaz.

   ^23For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he
   said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will
   I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of
   him, and of all Israel.

   ^24And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut
   in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the
   house of the Lord, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.

   ^25And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn
   incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the Lord God of his
   fathers.

   ^26Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last,
   behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

   ^27And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city,
   even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the
   kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 29

   Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he
   reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
   Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.

   ^2And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according
   to all that David his father had done.

   ^3He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the
   doors of the house of the Lord, and repaired them.

   ^4And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them
   together into the east street,

   ^5And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and
   sanctify the house of the Lord God of your fathers, and carry forth the
   filthiness out of the holy place.

   ^6For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the
   eyes of the Lord our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away
   their faces from the habitation of the Lord, and turned their backs.

   ^7Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps,
   and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy
   place unto the God of Israel.

   ^8Wherefore the wrath of the Lord was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he
   hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye
   see with your eyes.

   ^9For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our
   daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.

   ^10Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the Lord God of
   Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.

   ^11My sons, be not now negligent: for the Lord hath chosen you to stand
   before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and
   burn incense.

   ^12Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son
   of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari,
   Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the
   Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:

   ^13And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of
   Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:

   ^14And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of
   Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.

   ^15And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and
   came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the
   Lord, to cleanse the house of the Lord.

   ^16And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the Lord,
   to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in
   the temple of the Lord into the court of the house of the Lord. And the
   Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron.

   ^17Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and
   on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the Lord: so
   they sanctified the house of the Lord in eight days; and in the
   sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.

   ^18Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed
   all the house of the Lord, and the altar of burnt offering, with all
   the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels
   thereof.

   ^19Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away
   in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold,
   they are before the altar of the Lord.

   ^20Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the
   city, and went up to the house of the Lord.

   ^21And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs,
   and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the
   sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of
   Aaron to offer them on the altar of the Lord.

   ^22So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and
   sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams,
   they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs,
   and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.

   ^23And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the
   king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:

   ^24And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their
   blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king
   commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made
   for all Israel.

   ^25And he set the Levites in the house of the Lord with cymbals, with
   psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and
   of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the
   commandment of the Lord by his prophets.

   ^26And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests
   with the trumpets.

   ^27And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar.
   And when the burnt offering began, the song of the Lord began also with
   the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of
   Israel.

   ^28And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the
   trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was
   finished.

   ^29And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that
   were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.

   ^30Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to
   sing praise unto the Lord with the words of David, and of Asaph the
   seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads
   and worshipped.

   ^31Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves
   unto the Lord, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into
   the house of the Lord. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and
   thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.

   ^32And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation
   brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two
   hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the Lord.

   ^33And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand
   sheep.

   ^34But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the
   burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them,
   till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified
   themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify
   themselves than the priests.

   ^35And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the
   peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So
   the service of the house of the Lord was set in order.

   ^36And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the
   people: for the thing was done suddenly.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 30

   And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to
   Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the Lord at
   Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the Lord God of Israel.

   ^2For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
   congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.

   ^3For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not
   sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered
   themselves together to Jerusalem.

   ^4And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.

   ^5So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all
   Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the
   passover unto the Lord God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not
   done it of a long time in such sort as it was written.

   ^6So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes
   throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of
   the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the Lord God
   of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of
   you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.

   ^7And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which
   trespassed against the Lord God of their fathers, who therefore gave
   them up to desolation, as ye see.

   ^8Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves
   unto the Lord, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified
   for ever: and serve the Lord your God, that the fierceness of his wrath
   may turn away from you.

   ^9For if ye turn again unto the Lord, your brethren and your children
   shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they
   shall come again into this land: for the Lord your God is gracious and
   merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto
   him.

   ^10So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim
   and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and
   mocked them.

   ^11Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled
   themselves, and came to Jerusalem.

   ^12Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the
   commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the Lord.

   ^13And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of
   unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.

   ^14And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and
   all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook
   Kidron.

   ^15Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second
   month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified
   themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the
   Lord.

   ^16And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the
   law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which
   they received of the hand of the Levites.

   ^17For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified:
   therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers
   for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the Lord.

   ^18For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh,
   Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat
   the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for
   them, saying, The good Lord pardon every one

   ^19That prepareth his heart to seek God, the Lord God of his fathers,
   though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the
   sanctuary.

   ^20And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.

   ^21And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the
   feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the
   Levites and the priests praised the Lord day by day, singing with loud
   instruments unto the Lord.

   ^22And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the
   good knowledge of the Lord: and they did eat throughout the feast seven
   days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the Lord God
   of their fathers.

   ^23And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and
   they kept other seven days with gladness.

   ^24For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand
   bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the
   congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great
   number of priests sanctified themselves.

   ^25And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites,
   and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers
   that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.

   ^26So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon
   the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.

   ^27Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their
   voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place,
   even unto heaven.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 31

   Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out
   to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down
   the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all
   Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had
   utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned,
   every man to his possession, into their own cities.

   ^2And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites
   after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests
   and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister,
   and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the
   Lord.

   ^3He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt
   offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the
   burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the
   set feasts, as it is written in the law of the Lord.

   ^4Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the
   portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged
   in the law of the Lord.

   ^5And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel
   brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey,
   and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things
   brought they in abundantly.

   ^6And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the
   cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and
   the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the Lord their
   God, and laid them by heaps.

   ^7In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and
   finished them in the seventh month.

   ^8And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they
   blessed the Lord, and his people Israel.

   ^9Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning
   the heaps.

   ^10And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and
   said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of
   the Lord, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the Lord
   hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.

   ^11Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the
   Lord; and they prepared them,

   ^12And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things
   faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his
   brother was the next.

   ^13And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and
   Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were
   overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the
   commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of
   God.

   ^14And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east,
   was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of
   the Lord, and the most holy things.

   ^15And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah,
   Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set
   office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as
   to the small:

   ^16Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward,
   even unto every one that entereth into the house of the Lord, his daily
   portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;

   ^17Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers,
   and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by
   their courses;

   ^18And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and
   their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in
   their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:

   ^19Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of
   the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were
   expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests,
   and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.

   ^20And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which
   was good and right and truth before the Lord his God.

   ^21And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God,
   and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it
   with all his heart, and prospered.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 32

   After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of
   Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced
   cities, and thought to win them for himself.

   ^2And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was
   purposed to fight against Jerusalem,

   ^3He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the
   waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help
   him.

   ^4So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the
   fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land,
   saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?

   ^5Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was
   broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and
   repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in
   abundance.

   ^6And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them
   together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake
   comfortably to them, saying,

   ^7Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of
   Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more
   with us than with him:

   ^8With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the Lord our God to help
   us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the
   words of Hezekiah king of Judah.

   ^9After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to
   Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his
   power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that
   were at Jerusalem, saying,

   ^10Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye
   abide in the siege in Jerusalem?

   ^11Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by
   famine and by thirst, saying, The Lord our God shall deliver us out of
   the hand of the king of Assyria?

   ^12Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his
   altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship
   before one altar, and burn incense upon it?

   ^13Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of
   other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able
   to deliver their lands out of mine hand?

   ^14Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers
   utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that
   your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?

   ^15Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this
   manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom
   was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of
   my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?

   ^16And his servants spake yet more against the Lord God, and against
   his servant Hezekiah.

   ^17He wrote also letters to rail on the Lord God of Israel, and to
   speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands
   have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God
   of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.

   ^18Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the
   people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to
   trouble them; that they might take the city.

   ^19And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of
   the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.

   ^20And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son
   of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.

   ^21And the Lord sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of
   valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of
   Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he
   was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own
   bowels slew him there with the sword.

   ^22Thus the Lord saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from
   the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all
   other, and guided them on every side.

   ^23And many brought gifts unto the Lord to Jerusalem, and presents to
   Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all
   nations from thenceforth.

   ^24In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the
   Lord: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.

   ^25But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto
   him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him,
   and upon Judah and Jerusalem.

   ^26Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart,
   both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the Lord
   came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.

   ^27And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made
   himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones,
   and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels;

   ^28Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and
   stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.

   ^29Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds
   in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.

   ^30This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and
   brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And
   Hezekiah prospered in all his works.

   ^31Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of
   Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in
   the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in
   his heart.

   ^32Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they
   are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and
   in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

   ^33And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
   chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his
   son reigned in his stead.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 33

   Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
   fifty and five years in Jerusalem:

   ^2But did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, like unto the
   abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord had cast out before the
   children of Israel.

   ^3For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had
   broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and
   worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.

   ^4Also he built altars in the house of the Lord, whereof the Lord had
   said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.

   ^5And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of
   the house of the Lord.

   ^6And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of
   the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and
   used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he
   wrought much evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger.

   ^7And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house
   of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this
   house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of
   Israel, will I put my name for ever:

   ^8Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the
   land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take
   heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law
   and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.

   ^9So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and
   to do worse than the heathen, whom the Lord had destroyed before the
   children of Israel.

   ^10And the Lord spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would
   not hearken.

   ^11Wherefore the Lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the
   king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him
   with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.

   ^12And when he was in affliction, he besought the Lord his God, and
   humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,

   ^13And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his
   supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then
   Manasseh knew that the Lord he was God.

   ^14Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the
   west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish
   gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height,
   and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.

   ^15And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of
   the Lord, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the
   house of the Lord, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.

   ^16And he repaired the altar of the Lord, and sacrificed thereon peace
   offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the Lord
   God of Israel.

   ^17Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet
   unto the Lord their God only.

   ^18Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God,
   and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the Lord
   God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of
   Israel.

   ^19His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sin,
   and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set
   up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are
   written among the sayings of the seers.

   ^20So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own
   house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

   ^21Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
   reigned two years in Jerusalem.

   ^22But he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as did
   Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images
   which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;

   ^23And humbled not himself before the Lord, as Manasseh his father had
   humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.

   ^24And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own
   house.

   ^25But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against
   king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his
   stead.

    Chapter Chronicles 34

   Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in
   Jerusalem one and thirty years.

   ^2And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked
   in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right
   hand, nor to the left.

   ^3For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began
   to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he
   began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the
   groves, and the carved images, and the molten images.

   ^4And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the
   images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and
   the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made
   dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had
   sacrificed unto them.

   ^5And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed
   Judah and Jerusalem.

   ^6And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon,
   even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.

   ^7And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten
   the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout
   all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.

   ^8Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land,
   and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the
   governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to
   repair the house of the Lord his God.

   ^9And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the
   money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that
   kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of
   all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they
   returned to Jerusalem.

   ^10And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of
   the house of the Lord, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in
   the house of the Lord, to repair and amend the house:

   ^11Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone,
   and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of
   Judah had destroyed.

   ^12And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were
   Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah
   and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and
   other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.

   ^13Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of
   all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites
   there were scribes, and officers, and porters.

   ^14And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house
   of the Lord, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the Lord
   given by Moses.

   ^15And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found
   the book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Hilkiah delivered the
   book to Shaphan.

   ^16And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word
   back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do it.

   ^17And they have gathered together the money that was found in the
   house of the Lord, and have delivered it into the hand of the
   overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.

   ^18Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest
   hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.

   ^19And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law,
   that he rent his clothes.

   ^20And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and
   Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of
   the king's, saying,

   ^21Go, enquire of the Lord for me, and for them that are left in Israel
   and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great
   is the wrath of the Lord that is poured out upon us, because our
   fathers have not kept the word of the Lord, to do after all that is
   written in this book.

   ^22And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah
   the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of
   Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the
   college:) and they spake to her to that effect.

   ^23And she answered them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Tell ye
   the man that sent you to me,

   ^24Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and
   upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in
   the book which they have read before the king of Judah:

   ^25Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other
   gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their
   hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and
   shall not be quenched.

   ^26And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the Lord,
   so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel concerning
   the words which thou hast heard;

   ^27Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before
   God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the
   inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend
   thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the
   Lord.

   ^28Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be
   gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the
   evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the
   same. So they brought the king word again.

   ^29Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and
   Jerusalem.

   ^30And the king went up into the house of the Lord, and all the men of
   Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the
   Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears
   all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house
   of the Lord.

   ^31And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the
   Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep his commandments, and his
   testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his
   soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this
   book.

   ^32And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to
   stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the
   covenant of God, the God of their fathers.

   ^33And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries
   that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were
   present in Israel to serve, even to serve the Lord their God. And all
   his days they departed not from following the Lord, the God of their
   fathers.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter Chronicles 35

   Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the Lord in Jerusalem: and they
   killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.

   ^2And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the
   service of the house of the Lord,

   ^3And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy
   unto the Lord, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of
   David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your
   shoulders: serve now the Lord your God, and his people Israel,

   ^4And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your
   courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and
   according to the writing of Solomon his son.

   ^5And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the
   families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the
   division of the families of the Levites.

   ^6So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your
   brethren, that they may do according to the word of the Lord by the
   hand of Moses.

   ^7And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for
   the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of
   thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king's
   substance.

   ^8And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and
   to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house
   of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand
   and six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.

   ^9Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and
   Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the
   Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five
   hundred oxen.

   ^10So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place,
   and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment.

   ^11And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood
   from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.

   ^12And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according
   to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the Lord,
   as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.

   ^13And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance:
   but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in
   pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.

   ^14And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests:
   because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt
   offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for
   themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.

   ^15And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to
   the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's
   seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from
   their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.

   ^16So all the service of the Lord was prepared the same day, to keep
   the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the Lord,
   according to the commandment of king Josiah.

   ^17And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at
   that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.

   ^18And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days
   of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a
   passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all
   Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

   ^19In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover
   kept.

   ^20After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of
   Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah
   went out against him.

   ^21But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee,
   thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the
   house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear
   thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.

   ^22Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised
   himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words
   of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of
   Megiddo.

   ^23And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his
   servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.

   ^24His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in
   the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and
   he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And
   all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.

   ^25And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the
   singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and
   made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the
   lamentations.

   ^26Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to
   that which was written in the law of the Lord,

   ^27And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book
   of the kings of Israel and Judah.

    Chapter Chronicles 36

   Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made
   him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.

   ^2Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and
   he reigned three months in Jerusalem.

   ^3And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the
   land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.

   ^4And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and
   Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz
   his brother, and carried him to Egypt.

   ^5Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
   he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in
   the sight of the Lord his God.

   ^6Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in
   fetters, to carry him to Babylon.

   ^7Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the Lord
   to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.

   ^8Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he
   did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the
   book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned
   in his stead.

   ^9Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
   three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil
   in the sight of the Lord.

   ^10And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought
   him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the Lord, and
   made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem.

   ^11Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
   reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.

   ^12And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord his God, and
   humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth
   of the Lord.

   ^13And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him
   swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from
   turning unto the Lord God of Israel.

   ^14Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed
   very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the
   house of the Lord which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.

   ^15And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers,
   rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his
   people, and on his dwelling place:

   ^16But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and
   misused his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against his
   people, till there was no remedy.

   ^17Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew
   their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had
   no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped
   for age: he gave them all into his hand.

   ^18And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the
   treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king, and
   of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.

   ^19And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of
   Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed
   all the goodly vessels thereof.

   ^20And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon;
   where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the
   kingdom of Persia:

   ^21To fulfil the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the
   land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept
   sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.

   ^22Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the
   Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the Lord
   stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a
   proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing,
   saying,

   ^23Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath
   the Lord God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an
   house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all
   his people? The Lord his God be with him, and let him go up.

    Chapter 1

   Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the
   Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred up
   the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation
   throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,

   ^2Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The Lord God of heaven hath given me
   all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an
   house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.

   ^3Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and
   let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of
   the Lord God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.

   ^4And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men
   of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and
   with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is
   in Jerusalem.

   ^5Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the
   priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to
   go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem.

   ^6And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with
   vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with
   precious things, beside all that was willingly offered.

   ^7Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the
   Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had
   put them in the house of his gods;

   ^8Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of
   Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the
   prince of Judah.

   ^9And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand
   chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,

   ^10Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four hundred
   and ten, and other vessels a thousand.

   ^11All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four
   hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity
   that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.

   Addan, and Immer: but they could not shew their father's house, and
   their seed, whether they were of Israel:

   ^60The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of
   Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.

   ^61And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the
   children of Koz, the children of Barzillai; which took a wife of the
   daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name:

   ^62These sought their register among those that were reckoned by
   genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as polluted,
   put from the priesthood.

   ^63And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the
   most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with
   Thummim.

   ^64The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three
   hundred and threescore,

   ^65Beside their servants and their maids, of whom there were seven
   thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were among them two
   hundred singing men and singing women.

   ^66Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two
   hundred forty and five;

   ^67Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six
   thousand seven hundred and twenty.

   ^68And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of
   the Lord which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to
   set it up in his place:

   ^69They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work
   threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of
   silver, and one hundred priests garments.

   ^70So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the
   singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and
   all Israel in their cities.

    Chapter 3

   And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in
   the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to
   Jerusalem.

   ^2Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the
   priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and
   builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings
   thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.

   ^3And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because
   of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings
   thereon unto the Lord, even burnt offerings morning and evening.

   ^4They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and
   offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom,
   as the duty of every day required;

   ^5And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new
   moons, and of all the set feasts of the Lord that were consecrated, and
   of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the Lord.

   ^6From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt
   offerings unto the Lord. But the foundation of the temple of the Lord
   was not yet laid.

   ^7They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and
   meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to
   bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the
   grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.

   ^8Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at
   Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,
   and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the
   priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the
   captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years
   old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the Lord.

   ^9Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his
   sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the
   house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren
   the Levites.

   ^10And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord,
   they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites
   the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the Lord, after the ordinance
   of David king of Israel.

   ^11And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto
   the Lord; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward
   Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they
   praised the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord was
   laid.

   ^12But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who
   were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of
   this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many
   shouted aloud for joy:

   ^13So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy
   from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted
   with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.

    Chapter 4

   Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children
   of the captivity builded the temple unto the Lord God of Israel;

   ^2Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and
   said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do;
   and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar- haddon king of
   Assur, which brought us up hither.

   ^3But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers
   of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an
   house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the Lord
   God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.

   ^4Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of
   Judah, and troubled them in building,

   ^5And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all
   the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king
   of Persia.

   ^6And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote
   they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and
   Jerusalem.

   ^7And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and
   the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the
   writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted
   in the Syrian tongue.

   ^8Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against
   Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:

   ^9Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the
   rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the
   Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the
   Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,

   ^10And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper
   brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are
   on this side the river, and at such a time.

   ^11This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto
   Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and
   at such a time.

   ^12Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to
   us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city,
   and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.

   ^13Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and
   the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and
   custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.

   ^14Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was
   not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and
   certified the king;

   ^15That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers:
   so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city
   is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that
   they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause
   was this city destroyed.

   ^16We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the
   walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this
   side the river.

   ^17Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to
   Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in
   Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.

   ^18The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.

   ^19And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that
   this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that
   rebellion and sedition have been made therein.

   ^20There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled
   over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was
   paid unto them.

   ^21Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this
   city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me.

   ^22Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to
   the hurt of the kings?

   ^23Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum,
   and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to
   Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.

   ^24Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So
   it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 5

   Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo,
   prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name
   of the God of Israel, even unto them.

   ^2Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of
   Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and
   with them were the prophets of God helping them.

   ^3At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the
   river, and Shethar- boznai, and their companions, and said thus unto
   them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this
   wall?

   ^4Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the
   men that make this building?

   ^5But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they
   could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then
   they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.

   ^6The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river,
   and Shethar- boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which were
   on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:

   ^7They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius
   the king, all peace.

   ^8Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea,
   to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and
   timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and
   prospereth in their hands.

   ^9Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded
   you to build this house, and to make up these walls?

   ^10We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the
   names of the men that were the chief of them.

   ^11And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the
   God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these
   many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.

   ^12But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto
   wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of
   Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people
   away into Babylon.

   ^13But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king
   Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.

   ^14And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which
   Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and
   brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take
   out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose
   name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;

   ^15And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the
   temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his
   place.

   ^16Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house
   of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath
   it been in building, and yet it is not finished.

   ^17Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made
   in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be
   so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God
   at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this
   matter.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 6

   Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of
   the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.

   ^2And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the
   province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written:

   ^3In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a
   decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be
   builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the
   foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore
   cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;

   ^4With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the
   expences be given out of the king's house:

   ^5And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which
   Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and
   brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple
   which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the
   house of God.

   ^6Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, and
   your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye
   far from thence:

   ^7Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews
   and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.

   ^8Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews
   for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, even
   of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expences be given unto these
   men, that they be not hindered.

   ^9And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and
   lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine,
   and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at
   Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:

   ^10That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of
   heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.

   ^11Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let
   timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be
   hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.

   ^12And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all
   kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy
   this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree;
   let it be done with speed.

   ^13Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai, and
   their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so
   they did speedily.

   ^14And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the
   prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And
   they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God
   of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and
   Artaxerxes king of Persia.

   ^15And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar,
   which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.

   ^16And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the
   rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this
   house of God with joy,

   ^17And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred
   bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering
   for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes
   of Israel.

   ^18And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in
   their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is
   written in the book of Moses.

   ^19And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the
   fourteenth day of the first month.

   ^20For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them
   were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the
   captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves.

   ^21And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity,
   and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness
   of the heathen of the land, to seek the Lord God of Israel, did eat,

   ^22And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the
   Lord had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria
   unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God,
   the God of Israel.

    Chapter 7

   Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra
   the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,

   ^2The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,

   ^3The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,

   ^4The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,

   ^5The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son
   of Aaron the chief priest:

   ^6This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law
   of Moses, which the Lord God of Israel had given: and the king granted
   him all his request, according to the hand of the Lord his God upon
   him.

   ^7And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests,
   and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims,
   unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.

   ^8And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh
   year of the king.

   ^9For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from
   Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem,
   according to the good hand of his God upon him.

   ^10For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to
   do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.

   ^11Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave
   unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the
   commandments of the Lord, and of his statutes to Israel.

   ^12Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law
   of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time.

   ^13I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of his
   priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own
   freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.

   ^14Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven
   counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to
   the law of thy God which is in thine hand;

   ^15And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors
   have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in
   Jerusalem,

   ^16And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province
   of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the
   priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in
   Jerusalem:

   ^17That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs,
   with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them
   upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.

   ^18And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do
   with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of
   your God.

   ^19The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of
   thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem.

   ^20And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which
   thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's
   treasure house.

   ^21And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the
   treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest,
   the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be
   done speedily,

   ^22Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of
   wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil,
   and salt without prescribing how much.

   ^23Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently
   done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath
   against the realm of the king and his sons?

   ^24Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites,
   singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it
   shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.

   ^25And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand,
   set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are
   beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye
   them that know them not.

   ^26And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the
   king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether it be unto
   death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to
   imprisonment.

   ^27Blessed be the Lord God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing
   as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the Lord which is
   in Jerusalem:

   ^28And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his
   counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was
   strengthened as the hand of the Lord my God was upon me, and I gathered
   together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 8

   These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of
   them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the
   king.

   ^2Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of
   the sons of David; Hattush.

   ^3Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and
   with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty.

   ^4Of the sons of Pahath- moab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with
   him two hundred males.

   ^5Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three
   hundred males.

   ^6Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him
   fifty males.

   ^7And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him
   seventy males.

   ^8And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with
   him fourscore males.

   ^9Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two
   hundred and eighteen males.

   ^10And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him an
   hundred and threescore males.

   ^11And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him
   twenty and eight males.

   ^12And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him
   an hundred and ten males.

   ^13And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet,
   Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males.

   ^14Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy
   males.

   ^15And I gathered them together to the river than runneth to Ahava; and
   there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the
   priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.

   ^16Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan,
   and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and
   for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of
   understanding.

   ^17And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place
   Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to his
   brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring
   unto us ministers for the house of our God.

   ^18And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of
   understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of
   Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;

   ^19And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his
   brethren and their sons, twenty;

   ^20Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for
   the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of
   them were expressed by name.

   ^21Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might
   afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us,
   and for our little ones, and for all our substance.

   ^22For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and
   horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken
   unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good
   that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that
   forsake him.

   ^23So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of
   us.

   ^24Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah,
   Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,

   ^25And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels,
   even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his
   counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:

   ^26I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of
   silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred
   talents;

   ^27Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of
   fine copper, precious as gold.

   ^28And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the Lord; the vessels are
   holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the
   Lord God of your fathers.

   ^29Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the
   priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at
   Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the Lord.

   ^30So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and
   the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of
   our God.

   ^31Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the
   first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us,
   and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in
   wait by the way.

   ^32And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.

   ^33Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels
   weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of
   Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and
   with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui,
   Levites;

   ^34By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was written
   at that time.

   ^35Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were
   come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of
   Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy
   and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a
   burnt offering unto the Lord.

   ^36And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's
   lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they
   furthered the people, and the house of God.

    Chapter 9

   Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The
   people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated
   themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their
   abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the
   Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the
   Amorites.

   ^2For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their
   sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of
   those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in
   this trespass.

   ^3And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and
   plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied.

   ^4Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of
   the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been
   carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.

   ^5And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having
   rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my
   hands unto the Lord my God.

   ^6And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to
   thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our
   trespass is grown up unto the heavens.

   ^7Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto
   this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests,
   been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword,
   to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this
   day.

   ^8And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the Lord our
   God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy
   place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving
   in our bondage.

   ^9For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage,
   but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to
   give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the
   desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.

   ^10And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have
   forsaken thy commandments,

   ^11Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The
   land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the
   filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which
   have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.

   ^12Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take
   their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth
   for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and
   leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.

   ^13And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our
   great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our
   iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this;

   ^14Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with
   the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us
   till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor
   escaping?

   ^15O Lord God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped,
   as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our trespasses: for we
   cannot stand before thee because of this.

    Chapter 10

   Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and
   casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him
   out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children:
   for the people wept very sore.

   ^2And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered
   and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken
   strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in
   Israel concerning this thing.

   ^3Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the
   wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my
   lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let
   it be done according to the law.

   ^4Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be with
   thee: be of good courage, and do it.

   ^5Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all
   Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they
   sware.

   ^6Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the
   chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he
   did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the
   transgression of them that had been carried away.

   ^7And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all
   the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves
   together unto Jerusalem;

   ^8And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the
   counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be
   forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that
   had been carried away.

   ^9Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together
   unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the
   twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the
   house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.

   ^10And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have
   transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of
   Israel.

   ^11Now therefore make confession unto the Lord God of your fathers, and
   do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land,
   and from the strange wives.

   ^12Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As
   thou hast said, so must we do.

   ^13But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are
   not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two:
   for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.

   ^14Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them
   which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times,
   and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until
   the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.

   ^15Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were
   employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite
   helped them.

   ^16And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with
   certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all
   of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day
   of the tenth month to examine the matter.

   ^17And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives
   by the first day of the first month.

   ^18And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken
   strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and
   his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.

   ^19And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and
   being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass.

   ^20And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.

   ^21And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and
   Jehiel, and Uzziah.

   ^22And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel,
   Jozabad, and Elasah.

   ^23Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the same is
   Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.

   ^24Of the singers also; Eliashib: and of the porters; Shallum, and
   Telem, and Uri.

   ^25Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah, and
   Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.

   ^26And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi,
   and Jeremoth, and Eliah.

   ^27And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and
   Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.

   ^28Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai.

   ^29And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and
   Sheal, and Ramoth.

   ^30And of the sons of Pahath-moab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah,
   Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.

   ^31And of the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah,
   Shimeon,

   ^32Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.

   ^33Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet,
   Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.

   ^34Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel,

   ^35Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh,

   ^36Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,

   ^37Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau,

   ^38And Bani, and Binnui, Shimei,

   ^39And Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,

   ^40Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,

   ^41PrAzareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah,

   ^42Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph.

   ^43Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, and
   Joel, Benaiah.

   ^44All these had taken strange wives: and some of them had wives by
   whom they had children.

Nehemiah

    Chapter 1

   The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the
   month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,

   ^2That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah;
   and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left
   of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.

   ^3And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity
   there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of
   Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with
   fire.

   ^4And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and
   wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God
   of heaven,

   ^5And said, I beseech thee, O Lord God of heaven, the great and
   terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him
   and observe his commandments:

   ^6Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest
   hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and
   night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of
   the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and
   my father's house have sinned.

   ^7We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the
   commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou
   commandedst thy servant Moses.

   ^8Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant
   Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the
   nations:

   ^9But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though
   there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet
   will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that
   I have chosen to set my name there.

   ^10Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed
   by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.

   ^11O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer
   of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear
   thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him
   mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.

    Chapter 2

   And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of
   Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine,
   and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his
   presence.

   ^2Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing
   thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was
   very sore afraid,

   ^3And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my
   countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres,
   lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?

   ^4Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I
   prayed to the God of heaven.

   ^5And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant
   have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah,
   unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.

   ^6And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how
   long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the
   king to send me; and I set him a time.

   ^7Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be
   given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me
   over till I come into Judah;

   ^8And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may
   give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which
   appertained to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the
   house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to
   the good hand of my God upon me.

   ^9Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the
   king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen
   with me.

   ^10When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite,
   heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to
   seek the welfare of the children of Israel.

   ^11So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.

   ^12And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I
   any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was
   there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.

   ^13And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the
   dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem,
   which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.

   ^14Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's pool:
   but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.

   ^15Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and
   turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so returned.

   ^16And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I
   as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor
   to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.

   ^17Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how
   Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire:
   come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a
   reproach.

   ^18Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as
   also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us
   rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good work.

   ^19But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
   Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn,
   and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel
   against the king?

   ^20Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will
   prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have
   no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.

    Chapter 3

   Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests,

   wall of the pool of Siloah by the king's garden, and unto the stairs
   that go down from the city of David.

    Chapter 4

   But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the
   wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.

   ^2And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said,
   What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they
   sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones
   out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?

   ^3Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they
   build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.

   ^4Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon
   their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:

   ^5And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out
   from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the
   builders.

   ^6So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the
   half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.

   ^7But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the
   Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls
   of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped,
   then they were very wroth,

   ^8And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against
   Jerusalem, and to hinder it.

   ^9Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against
   them day and night, because of them.

   ^10And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed,
   and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.

   ^11And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we
   come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to
   cease.

   ^12And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came,
   they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return
   unto us they will be upon you.

   ^13Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the
   higher places, I even set the people after their families with their
   swords, their spears, and their bows.

   ^14And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the
   rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them:
   remember the Lord, which is great and terrible, and fight for your
   brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.

   ^15And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto
   us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all
   of us to the wall, every one unto his work.

   ^16And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my
   servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the
   spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers
   were behind all the house of Judah.

   ^17They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with
   those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work,
   and with the other hand held a weapon.

   ^18For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so
   builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.

   ^19And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of
   the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the
   wall, one far from another.

   ^20In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye
   thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.

   ^21So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from
   the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.

   ^22Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with
   his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a
   guard to us, and labour on the day.

   ^23So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the
   guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that
   every one put them off for washing.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 5

   And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against
   their brethren the Jews.

   ^2For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many:
   therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.

   ^3Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,
   vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.

   ^4There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's
   tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.

   ^5Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as
   their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our
   daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto
   bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other
   men have our lands and vineyards.

   ^6And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.

   ^7Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the
   rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother.
   And I set a great assembly against them.

   ^8And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren
   the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your
   brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace,
   and found nothing to answer.

   ^9Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the
   fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?

   ^10I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them
   money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.

   ^11Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their
   vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the the hundredth
   part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye
   exact of them.

   ^12Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of
   them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took
   an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.

   ^13Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his
   house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus
   be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and
   praised the Lord. And the people did according to this promise.

   ^14Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in
   the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and
   thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my
   brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.

   ^15But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable
   unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty
   shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people:
   but so did not I, because of the fear of God.

   ^16Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we
   any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.

   ^17Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and
   rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are
   about us.

   ^18Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice
   sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of
   all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of the
   governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.

   ^19Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done
   for this people.

    Chapter 6

   Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the
   Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the
   wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I
   had not set up the doors upon the gates;)

   ^2That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet
   together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they
   thought to do me mischief.

   ^3And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so
   that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it,
   and come down to you?

   ^4Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them
   after the same manner.

   ^5Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time
   with an open letter in his hand;

   ^6Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu
   saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou
   buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these
   words.

   ^7And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem,
   saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the
   king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take
   counsel together.

   ^8Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou
   sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.

   ^9For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened
   from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my
   hands.

   ^10Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the
   son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together
   in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of
   the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will
   they come to slay thee.

   ^11And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that,
   being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go
   in.

   ^12And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he
   pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired
   him.

   ^13Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin,
   and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might
   reproach me.

   ^14My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these
   their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the
   prophets, that would have put me in fear.

   ^15So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month
   Elul, in fifty and two days.

   ^16And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and
   all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much
   cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was
   wrought of our God.

   ^17Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto
   Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.

   ^18For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son
   in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the
   daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.

   ^19Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to
   him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 7

   Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the
   doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,

   ^2That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace,
   charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above
   many.

   ^3And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until
   the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and
   bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every
   one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.

   ^4Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein,
   and the houses were not builded.

   ^5And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the
   rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I
   found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first,
   and found written therein,

   ^6These are the children of the province, that went up out of the
   captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the
   king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to
   Judah, every one unto his city;

   ^7Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah,
   Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The
   number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was this;

   ^8The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and two.

   ^9The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two.

   ^10The children of Arah, six hundred fifty and two.

   ^11The children of Pahath-moab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab, two
   thousand and eight hundred and eighteen.

   ^12The children of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four.

   ^13The children of Zattu, eight hundred forty and five.

   ^14The children of Zaccai, seven hundred and threescore.

   ^15The children of Binnui, six hundred forty and eight.

   ^16The children of Bebai, six hundred twenty and eight.

   ^17The children of Azgad, two thousand three hundred twenty and two.

   ^18The children of Adonikam, six hundred threescore and seven.

   ^19The children of Bigvai, two thousand threescore and seven.

   ^20The children of Adin, six hundred fifty and five.

   ^21The children of Ater of Hezekiah, ninety and eight.

   ^22The children of Hashum, three hundred twenty and eight.

   ^23The children of Bezai, three hundred twenty and four.

   ^24The children of Hariph, an hundred and twelve.

   ^25The children of Gibeon, ninety and five.

   ^26The men of Bethlehem and Netophah, an hundred fourscore and eight.

   ^27The men of Anathoth, an hundred twenty and eight.

   ^28The men of Beth- azmaveth, forty and two.

   ^29The men of Kirjathjearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred
   forty and three.

   ^30The men of Ramah and Gaba, six hundred twenty and one.

   ^31The men of Michmas, an hundred and twenty and two.

   ^32The men of Bethel and Ai, an hundred twenty and three.

   ^33The men of the other Nebo, fifty and two.

   ^34The children of the other Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and
   four.

   ^35The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty.

   ^36The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five.

   ^37The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and one.

   ^38The children of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty.

   ^39The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine
   hundred seventy and three.

   ^40The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.

   ^41The children of Pashur, a thousand two hundred forty and seven.

   ^42The children of Harim, a thousand and seventeen.

   ^43The Levites: the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, and of the children
   of Hodevah, seventy and four.

   ^44The singers: the children of Asaph, an hundred forty and eight.

   ^45The porters: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the
   children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, the
   children of Shobai, an hundred thirty and eight.

   ^46The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hashupha, the
   children of Tabbaoth,

   ^47The children of Keros, the children of Sia, the children of Padon,

   ^48The children of Lebana, the children of Hagaba, the children of
   Shalmai,

   ^49The children of Hanan, the children of Giddel, the children of
   Gahar,

   ^50The children of Reaiah, the children of Rezin, the children of
   Nekoda,

   ^51The children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of
   Phaseah,

   ^52The children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children of
   Nephishesim,

   ^53The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of
   Harhur,

   ^54The children of Bazlith, the children of Mehida, the children of
   Harsha,

   ^55The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of
   Tamah,

   ^56The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.

   ^57The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the
   children of Sophereth, the children of Perida,

   ^58The children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of
   Giddel,

   ^59The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of
   Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon.

   ^60All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were
   three hundred ninety and two.

   ^61And these were they which went up also from Telmelah, Telharesha,
   Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew their father's house,
   nor their seed, whether they were of Israel.

   ^62The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of
   Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.

   ^63And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz,
   the children of Barzillai, which took one of the daughters of Barzillai
   the Gileadite to wife, and was called after their name.

   ^64These sought their register among those that were reckoned by
   genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put
   from the priesthood.

   ^65And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the
   most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim.

   ^66The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three
   hundred and threescore,

   ^67Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there were
   seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred
   forty and five singing men and singing women.

   ^68Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two hundred
   forty and five:

   ^69Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven
   hundred and twenty asses.

   ^70And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The
   Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basons,
   five hundred and thirty priests' garments.

   ^71And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the
   work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred
   pounds of silver.

   ^72And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams
   of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and threescore and seven
   priests' garments.

   ^73So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers,
   and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in
   their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel
   were in their cities.

    Chapter 8

   And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the
   street that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the
   scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the Lord had
   commanded to Israel.

   ^2And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of
   men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the
   first day of the seventh month.

   ^3And he read therein before the street that was before the water gate
   from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those
   that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive
   unto the book of the law.

   ^4And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made
   for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and
   Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and
   on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and
   Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.

   ^5And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was
   above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:

   ^6And Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God. And all the people
   answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their
   heads, and worshipped the Lord with their faces to the ground.

   ^7Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai,
   Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the
   Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood
   in their place.

   ^8So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the
   sense, and caused them to understand the reading.

   ^9And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe,
   and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This
   day is holy unto the Lord your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the
   people wept, when they heard the words of the law.

   ^10Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the
   sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for
   this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the
   Lord is your strength.

   ^11So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for
   the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.

   ^12And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send
   portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the
   words that were declared unto them.

   ^13And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the
   fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the
   scribe, even to understand the words of the law.

   ^14And they found written in the law which the Lord had commanded by
   Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast
   of the seventh month:

   ^15And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and
   in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive
   branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches,
   and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.

   ^16So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves
   booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and
   in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate,
   and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.

   ^17And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the
   captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of
   Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done
   so. And there was very great gladness.

   ^18Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in
   the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on
   the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 9

   Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel
   were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.

   ^2And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and
   stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.

   ^3And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of
   the Lord their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part
   they confessed, and worshipped the Lord their God.

   ^4Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani,
   Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with
   a loud voice unto the Lord their God.

   ^5Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah,
   Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the Lord
   your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is
   exalted above all blessing and praise.

   ^6Thou, even thou, art Lord alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of
   heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are
   therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them
   all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.

   ^7Thou art the Lord the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him
   forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham;

   ^8And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant
   with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the
   Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites,
   to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou
   art righteous:

   ^9And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest
   their cry by the Red sea;

   ^10And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his
   servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they
   dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is
   this day.

   ^11And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through
   the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou
   threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.

   ^12Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the
   night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they
   should go.

   ^13Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from
   heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes
   and commandments:

   ^14And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them
   precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:

   ^15And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest
   forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst
   them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn
   to give them.

   ^16But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks,
   and hearkened not to thy commandments,

   ^17And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou
   didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion
   appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God
   ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great
   kindness, and forsookest them not.

   ^18Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy
   God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great
   provocations;

   ^19Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the
   wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to
   lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them
   light, and the way wherein they should go.

   ^20Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest
   not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.

   ^21Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that
   they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet
   swelled not.

   ^22Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide
   them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of
   the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.

   ^23Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and
   broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to
   their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.

   ^24So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst
   before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest
   them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land,
   that they might do with them as they would.

   ^25And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses
   full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit
   trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat,
   and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.

   ^26Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and
   cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified
   against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.

   ^27Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who
   vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto
   thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold
   mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of
   their enemies.

   ^28But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore
   leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the
   dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou
   heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them
   according to thy mercies;

   ^29And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again
   unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy
   commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he
   shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their
   neck, and would not hear.

   ^30Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them
   by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore
   gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.

   ^31Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly
   consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful
   God.

   ^32Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God,
   who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little
   before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and
   on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy
   people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.

   ^33Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast
   done right, but we have done wickedly:

   ^34Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers,
   kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies,
   wherewith thou didst testify against them.

   ^35For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great
   goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which
   thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.

   ^36Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest
   unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold,
   we are servants in it:

   ^37And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over
   us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and
   over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.

   ^38And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and
   our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.

   ^29They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a
   curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses
   the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the
   Lord our Lord, and his judgments and his statutes;

   ^30And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the
   land, nor take their daughters for our sons:

   ^31And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the
   sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath,
   or on the holy day: and that we would leave the seventh year, and the
   exaction of every debt.

   ^32Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the
   third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;

   ^33For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and for the
   continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the
   set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make
   an atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God.

   ^34And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people,
   for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, after the
   houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn upon
   the altar of the Lord our God, as it is written in the law:

   ^35And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits of
   all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the house of the Lord:

   ^36Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written
   in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring
   to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of
   our God:

   ^37And that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our
   offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil,
   unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the
   tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the same Levites might have
   the tithes in all the cities of our tillage.

   ^38And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the
   Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the
   tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure
   house.

   ^39For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the
   offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil, unto the chambers,
   where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister,
   and the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of
   our God.

    Chapter 11

   And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of the people
   also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy
   city, and nine parts to dwell in other cities.

   ^2And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered themselves
   to dwell at Jerusalem.

   ^3Now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem: but
   in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their
   cities, to wit, Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the
   Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants.

   ^4And at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and of the
   children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah; Athaiah the son of
   Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of
   Shephatiah, the son of Mahalaleel, of the children of Perez;

   ^5And Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Col-hozeh, the son of
   Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah,
   the son of Shiloni.

   ^6All the sons of Perez that dwelt at Jerusalem were four hundred
   threescore and eight valiant men.

   ^7And these are the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of Meshullam, the
   son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of
   Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jesaiah.

   ^8And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty and eight.

   ^9And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer: and Judah the son of
   Senuah was second over the city.

   ^10Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin.

   ^11Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok,
   the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, was the ruler of the house of
   God.

   ^12And their brethren that did the work of the house were eight hundred
   twenty and two: and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the
   son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashur, the son of
   Malchiah,

   ^13And his brethren, chief of the fathers, two hundred forty and two:
   and Amashai the son of PrAzareel, the son of Ahasai, the son of
   Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,

   ^14And their brethren, mighty men of valour, an hundred twenty and
   eight: and their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of one of the great men.

   ^15Also of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hashub, the son of Azrikam,
   the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;

   ^16And Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chief of the Levites, had the
   oversight of the outward business of the house of God.

   ^17And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph,
   was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer: and Bakbukiah
   the second among his brethren, and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of
   Galal, the son of Jeduthun.

   ^18All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and
   four.

   ^19Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren that kept
   the gates, were an hundred seventy and two.

   ^20And the residue of Israel, of the priests, and the Levites, were in
   all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance.

   ^21But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were over the
   Nethinims.

   ^22The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of
   Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micha. Of
   the sons of Asaph, the singers were over the business of the house of
   God.

   ^23For it was the king's commandment concerning them, that a certain
   portion should be for the singers, due for every day.

   ^24And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah the
   son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters concerning the
   people.

   ^25And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children of
   Judah dwelt at Kirjatharba, and in the villages thereof, and at Dibon,
   and in the villages thereof, and at Jekabzeel, and in the villages
   thereof,

   ^26And at Jeshua, and at Moladah, and at Beth-phelet,

   ^27And at Hazarshual, and at Beersheba, and in the villages thereof,

   thereof, at Azekah, and in the villages thereof. And they dwelt from
   Beersheba unto the valley of Hinnom.

   ^31The children also of Benjamin from Geba dwelt at Michmash, and Aija,
   and Bethel, and in their villages,

   ^32And at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,

   ^33Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,

   ^34Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,

   ^35Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.

   ^36And of the Levites were divisions in Judah, and in Benjamin.

    Chapter 12

   Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel
   the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,

   ^2Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,

   ^3Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,

   ^4Iddo, Ginnetho, Abijah,

   ^5Miamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,

   ^6Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah,

   ^7Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the chief of the priests
   and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua.

   ^8Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and
   Mattaniah, which was over the thanksgiving, he and his brethren.

   ^9Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were over against them in
   the watches.

   ^10And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and Eliashib
   begat Joiada,

   ^11And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.

   ^12And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the fathers:
   of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;

   ^13Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;

   ^14Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;

   ^15Of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;

   ^16Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;

   ^17Of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai;

   ^18Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;

   ^19And of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;

   ^20Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;

   ^21Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethaneel.

   ^22The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and
   Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests, to the
   reign of Darius the Persian.

   ^23The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the book
   of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.

   ^24And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the
   son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and to
   give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward
   over against ward.

   ^25Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were
   porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.

   ^26These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of
   Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the
   priest, the scribe.

   ^27And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the
   Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep
   the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with
   singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.

   ^28And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out
   of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of
   Netophathi;

   ^29Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and
   Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about
   Jerusalem.

   ^30And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified
   the people, and the gates, and the wall.

   ^31Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed
   two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the
   right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:

   ^32And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,

   ^33And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,

   ^34Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,

   ^35And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely, Zechariah
   the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son
   of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:

   ^36And his brethren, Shemaiah, and PrAzarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai,
   Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the
   man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.

   ^37And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up
   by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above
   the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.

   ^38And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against
   them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from
   beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall;

   ^39And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and
   above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah,
   even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.

   ^40So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of
   God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:

   ^41And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai,
   Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;

   ^42And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan,
   and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with
   Jezrahiah their overseer.

   ^43Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God
   had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children
   rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.

   ^44And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the
   treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes,
   to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the
   law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and
   for the Levites that waited.

   ^45And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and
   the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David,
   and of Solomon his son.

   ^46For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the
   singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.

   ^47And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of
   Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day
   his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the
   Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 13

   On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the
   people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the
   Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;

   ^2Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with
   water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them:
   howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.

   ^3Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated
   from Israel all the mixed multitude.

   ^4And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the
   chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:

   ^5And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they
   laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the
   tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to
   be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the
   offerings of the priests.

   ^6But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and
   thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and
   after certain days obtained I leave of the king:

   ^7And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did
   for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of
   God.

   ^8And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household
   stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.

   ^9Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought
   I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the
   frankincense.

   ^10And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given
   them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled
   every one to his field.

   ^11Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God
   forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.

   ^12Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and
   the oil unto the treasuries.

   ^13And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and
   Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was
   Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted
   faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren.

   ^14Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good
   deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices
   thereof.

   ^15In those days saw I in Judah some treading winepresses on the
   sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine,
   grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into
   Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day
   wherein they sold victuals.

   ^16There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all
   manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and
   in Jerusalem.

   ^17Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What
   evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?

   ^18Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil
   upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by
   profaning the sabbath.

   ^19And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be
   dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and
   charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some
   of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be
   brought in on the sabbath day.

   ^20So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without
   Jerusalem once or twice.

   ^21Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye
   about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that
   time forth came they no more on the sabbath.

   ^22And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and
   that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day.
   Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to
   the greatness of thy mercy.

   ^23In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of
   Ammon, and of Moab:

   ^24And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not
   speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each
   people.

   ^25And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of
   them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying,
   Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their
   daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.

   ^26Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many
   nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God
   made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish
   women cause to sin.

   ^27Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to
   transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?

   ^28And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest,
   was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from
   me.

   ^29Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood,
   and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.

   ^30Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of
   the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;

   ^31And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the
   firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

    Chapter 1

   Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which
   reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and
   twenty provinces:)

   ^2That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his
   kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,

   ^3In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes
   and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes
   of the provinces, being before him:

   ^4When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of
   his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days.

   ^5And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the
   people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and
   small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace;

   ^6Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of
   fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds
   were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white,
   and black, marble.

   ^7And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being
   diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to
   the state of the king.

   ^8And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so
   the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they
   should do according to every man's pleasure.

   ^9Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house
   which belonged to king Ahasuerus.

   ^10On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine,
   he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and
   Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus
   the king,

   ^11To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to
   shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look
   on.

   ^12But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by
   his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger
   burned in him.

   ^13Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so
   was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment:

   ^14And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish,
   Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media,
   which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)

   ^15What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because she
   hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the
   chamberlains?

   ^16And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the
   queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the
   princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the
   king Ahasuerus.

   ^17For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that
   they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be
   reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought
   in before him, but she came not.

   ^18Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all
   the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus
   shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.

   ^19If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him,
   and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes,
   that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus;
   and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than
   she.

   ^20And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published
   throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give
   to their husbands honour, both to great and small.

   ^21And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did
   according to the word of Memucan:

   ^22For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every
   province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after
   their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and
   that it should be published according to the language of every people.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 2

   After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he
   remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against
   her.

   ^2Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be
   fair young virgins sought for the king:

   ^3And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his
   kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto
   Shushan the palace, to the house of the women unto the custody of Hege
   the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for
   purification be given them:

   ^4And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of
   Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.

   ^5Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was
   Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a
   Benjamite;

   ^6Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had
   been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the
   king of Babylon had carried away.

   ^7And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter:
   for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and
   beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took
   for his own daughter.

   ^8So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was
   heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the
   palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the
   king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.

   ^9And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he
   speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as
   belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her,
   out of the king's house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the
   best place of the house of the women.

   ^10Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had
   charged her that she should not shew it.

   ^11And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house,
   to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.

   ^12Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus,
   after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the
   women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to
   wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours,
   and with other things for the purifying of the women;)

   ^13Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired
   was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the
   king's house.

   ^14In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the
   second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's
   chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no
   more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by
   name.

   ^15Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of
   Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto
   the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain,
   the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the
   sight of all them that looked upon her.

   ^16So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the
   tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his
   reign.

   ^17And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained
   grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set
   the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.

   ^18Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his
   servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces,
   and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.

   ^19And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then
   Mordecai sat in the king's gate.

   ^20Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai
   had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as
   when she was brought up with him.

   ^21In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the
   king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door,
   were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.

   ^22And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the
   queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name.

   ^23And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out;
   therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the
   book of the chronicles before the king.

    Chapter 3

   After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of
   Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all
   the princes that were with him.

   ^2And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and
   reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But
   Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.

   ^3Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto
   Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?

   ^4Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened
   not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters
   would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.

   ^5And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence,
   then was Haman full of wrath.

   ^6And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had
   shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy
   all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even
   the people of Mordecai.

   ^7In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of
   king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day
   to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the
   month Adar.

   ^8And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people
   scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of
   thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep
   they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to
   suffer them.

   ^9If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed:
   and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those
   that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's
   treasuries.

   ^10And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the
   son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.

   ^11And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the
   people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.

   ^12Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of the
   first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had
   commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were
   over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every
   province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after
   their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and
   sealed with the king's ring.

   ^13And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to
   destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old,
   little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of
   the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of
   them for a prey.

   ^14The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
   province was published unto all people, that they should be ready
   against that day.

   ^15The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment, and
   the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat
   down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 4

   When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes,
   and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the
   city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;

   ^2And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the
   king's gate clothed with sackcloth.

   ^3And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment and his
   decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and
   weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.

   ^4So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was
   the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai,
   and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not.

   ^5Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom
   he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to
   Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.

   ^6So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city, which
   was before the king's gate.

   ^7And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and of the
   sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's
   treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.

   ^8Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given
   at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it
   unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to
   make supplication unto him, and to make request before him for her
   people.

   ^9And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.

   ^10Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto
   Mordecai;

   ^11All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do
   know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king
   into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put
   him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden
   sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto
   the king these thirty days.

   ^12And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.

   ^13Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself
   that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than all the Jews.

   ^14For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall
   there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place;
   but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth
   whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?

   ^15Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,

   ^16Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and
   fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I
   also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the
   king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.

   ^17So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had
   commanded him.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 5

   Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal
   apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, over against
   the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal
   house, over against the gate of the house.

   ^2And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the
   court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to
   Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near,
   and touched the top of the sceptre.

   ^3Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what
   is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.

   ^4And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and
   Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.

   ^5Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as
   Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther
   had prepared.

   ^6And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy
   petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even
   to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.

   ^7Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;

   ^8If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the
   king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and
   Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do
   to morrow as the king hath said.

   ^9Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when
   Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood not up, nor moved
   for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.

   ^10Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent
   and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.

   ^11And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of
   his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and
   how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.

   ^12Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in
   with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to
   morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.

   ^13Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew
   sitting at the king's gate.

   ^14Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a
   gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the
   king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with
   the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused
   the gallows to be made.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 6

   On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the
   book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king.

   ^2And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and
   Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who
   sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.

   ^3And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai
   for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There
   is nothing done for him.

   ^4And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the
   outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to hang
   Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.

   ^5And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the
   court. And the king said, Let him come in.

   ^6So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto
   the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his
   heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?

   ^7And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to
   honour,

   ^8Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear, and
   the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set
   upon his head:

   ^9And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the
   king's most noble princes, that they may array the man withal whom the
   king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the
   street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to
   the man whom the king delighteth to honour.

   ^10Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and
   the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that
   sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of all that thou hast
   spoken.

   ^11Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and
   brought him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaimed
   before him, Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth
   to honour.

   ^12And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his
   house mourning, and having his head covered.

   ^13And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that
   had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him,
   If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to
   fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before
   him.

   ^14And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's
   chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther
   had prepared.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 7

   So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.

   ^2And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet
   of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted
   thee: and what is thy request? and it shall be performed, even to the
   half of the kingdom.

   ^3Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favour in
   thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me
   at my petition, and my people at my request:

   ^4For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and
   to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had
   held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's
   damage.

   ^5Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen, Who
   is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?

   ^6And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then
   Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.

   ^7And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into
   the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make request for his life to
   Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him
   by the king.

   ^8Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the
   banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was.
   Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the
   house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's
   face.

   ^9And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold
   also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai,
   who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then
   the king said, Hang him thereon.

   ^10So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
   Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 8

   On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews'
   enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king; for
   Esther had told what he was unto her.

   ^2And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and
   gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.

   ^3And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at his
   feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the
   Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.

   ^4Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther
   arose, and stood before the king,

   ^5And said, If it please the king, and if I have found favour in his
   sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in
   his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the
   son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which
   are in all the king's provinces:

   ^6For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people?
   or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?

   ^7Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai
   the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they
   have hanged upon the gallows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews.

   ^8Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and
   seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is written in the
   king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse.

   ^9Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third month,
   that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth day thereof; and
   it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews,
   and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces
   which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven
   provinces, unto every province according to the writing thereof, and
   unto every people after their language, and to the Jews according to
   their writing, and according to their language.

   ^10And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the
   king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on
   mules, camels, and young dromedaries:

   ^11Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather
   themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay,
   and to cause to perish, all the power of the people and province that
   would assault them, both little ones and women, and to take the spoil
   of them for a prey,

   ^12Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon
   the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.

   ^13The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
   province was published unto all people, and that the Jews should be
   ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.

   ^14So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being
   hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the decree was
   given at Shushan the palace.

   ^15And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel
   of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment
   of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was
   glad.

   ^16The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.

   ^17And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's
   commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a feast
   and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the
   fear of the Jews fell upon them.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 9

   Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth
   day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near
   to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped
   to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that
   the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)

   ^2The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all
   the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought
   their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell
   upon all people.

   ^3And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the
   deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear
   of Mordecai fell upon them.

   ^4For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out
   throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and
   greater.

   ^5Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword,
   and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that
   hated them.

   ^6And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred
   men.

   ^7And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,

   ^8And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,

   ^9And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,

   ^10The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews,
   slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.

   ^11On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the
   palace was brought before the king.

   ^12And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and
   destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of
   Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now
   what is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy
   request further? and it shall be done.

   ^13Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the
   Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this
   day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.

   ^14And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at
   Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.

   ^15For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on
   the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men
   at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.

   ^16But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered
   themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their
   enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they
   laid not their hands on the prey,

   ^17On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day
   of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.

   ^18But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the
   thirteenth day thereof; and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the
   fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting
   and gladness.

   ^19Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled
   towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and
   feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.

   ^20And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews
   that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and
   far,

   ^21To stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth
   day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,

   ^22As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the
   month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning
   into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy,
   and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.

   ^23And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had
   written unto them;

   ^24Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all
   the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast
   Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;

   ^25But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that
   his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return
   upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the
   gallows.

   ^26Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.
   Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had
   seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,

   ^27The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon
   all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that
   they would keep these two days according to their writing, and
   according to their appointed time every year;

   ^28And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every
   generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that
   these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the
   memorial of them perish from their seed.

   ^29Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the
   Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.

   ^30And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and
   seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and
   truth,

   ^31To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according
   as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they
   had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the
   fastings and their cry.

   ^32And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it
   was written in the book.

    Chapter 10

   And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles
   of the sea.

   ^2And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration
   of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they
   not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and
   Persia?

   ^3For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among
   the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the
   wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.

  The Book of

Job
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 1

   There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was
   perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.

   ^2And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.

   ^3His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand
   camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and
   a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the
   men of the east.

   ^4And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and
   sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.

   ^5And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that
   Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and
   offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job
   said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their
   hearts. Thus did Job continually.

   ^6Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves
   before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.

   ^7And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered
   the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from
   walking up and down in it.

   ^8And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,
   that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man,
   one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?

   ^9Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?

   ^10Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and
   about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his
   hands, and his substance is increased in the land.

   ^11But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he
   will curse thee to thy face.

   ^12And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy
   power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth
   from the presence of the Lord.

   ^13And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and
   drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:

   ^14And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were
   plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:

   ^15And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have
   slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped
   alone to tell thee.

   ^16While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The
   fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and
   the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell
   thee.

   ^17While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The
   Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have
   carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the
   sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

   ^18While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy
   sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest
   brother's house:

   ^19And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote
   the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they
   are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.

   ^20Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell
   down upon the ground, and worshipped,

   ^21And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I
   return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be
   the name of the Lord.

   ^22In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 2

   Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves
   before the Lord, and Satan came also among them to present himself
   before the Lord.

   ^2And the Lord said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan
   answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and
   from walking up and down in it.

   ^3And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,
   that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man,
   one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his
   integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without
   cause.

   ^4And Satan answered the Lord, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a
   man hath will he give for his life.

   ^5But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and
   he will curse thee to thy face.

   ^6And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save
   his life.

   ^7So went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job with
   sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.

   ^8And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down
   among the ashes.

   ^9Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?
   curse God, and die.

   ^10But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women
   speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we
   not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.

   ^11Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come
   upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite,
   and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an
   appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.

   ^12And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they
   lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle,
   and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.

   ^13So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven
   nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was
   very great.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 3

   After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.

   ^2And Job spake, and said,

   ^3Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was
   said, There is a man child conceived.

   ^4Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither
   let the light shine upon it.

   ^5Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon
   it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.

   ^6As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined
   unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the
   months.

   ^7Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.

   ^8Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their
   mourning.

   ^9Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light,
   but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:

   ^10Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow
   from mine eyes.

   ^11Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I
   came out of the belly?

   ^12Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?

   ^13For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have
   slept: then had I been at rest,

   ^14With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places
   for themselves;

   ^15Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:

   ^16Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which
   never saw light.

   ^17There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at
   rest.

   ^18There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the
   oppressor.

   ^19The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his
   master.

   ^20Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the
   bitter in soul;

   ^21Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than
   for hid treasures;

   ^22Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the
   grave?

   ^23Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath
   hedged in?

   ^24For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out
   like the waters.

   ^25For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which
   I was afraid of is come unto me.

   ^26I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet
   trouble came.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 4

   Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

   ^2If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can
   withhold himself from speaking?

   ^3Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the
   weak hands.

   ^4Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast
   strengthened the feeble knees.

   ^5But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee,
   and thou art troubled.

   ^6Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness
   of thy ways?

   ^7Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where
   were the righteous cut off?

   ^8Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness,
   reap the same.

   ^9By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils
   are they consumed.

   ^10The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the
   teeth of the young lions, are broken.

   ^11The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps
   are scattered abroad.

   ^12Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a
   little thereof.

   ^13In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth
   on men,

   ^14Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.

   ^15Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:

   ^16It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image
   was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,

   ^17Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure
   than his maker?

   ^18Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged
   with folly:

   ^19How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation
   is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?

   ^20They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever
   without any regarding it.

   ^21Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even
   without wisdom.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 5

   Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the
   saints wilt thou turn?

   ^2For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.

   ^3I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his
   habitation.

   ^4His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate,
   neither is there any to deliver them.

   ^5Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the
   thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.

   ^6Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth
   trouble spring out of the ground;

   ^7Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.

   ^8I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:

   ^9Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without
   number:

   ^10Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:

   ^11To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be
   exalted to safety.

   ^12He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands
   cannot perform their enterprise.

   ^13He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the
   froward is carried headlong.

   ^14They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as
   in the night.

   ^15But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from
   the hand of the mighty.

   ^16So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.

   ^17Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not
   thou the chastening of the Almighty:

   ^18For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make
   whole.

   ^19He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no
   evil touch thee.

   ^20In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power
   of the sword.

   ^21Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou
   be afraid of destruction when it cometh.

   ^22At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be
   afraid of the beasts of the earth.

   ^23For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the
   beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.

   ^24And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou
   shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.

   ^25Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine
   offspring as the grass of the earth.

   ^26Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn
   cometh in in his season.

   ^27Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it
   for thy good.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 6

   But Job answered and said,

   ^2O that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the
   balances together!

   ^3For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my
   words are swallowed up.

   ^4For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof
   drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array
   against me.

   ^5Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his
   fodder?

   ^6Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any
   taste in the white of an egg?

   ^7The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.

   ^8Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the
   thing that I long for!

   ^9Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose
   his hand, and cut me off!

   ^10Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in
   sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the
   Holy One.

   ^11What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that
   I should prolong my life?

   ^12Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?

   ^13Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?

   ^14To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but
   he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.

   ^15My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of
   brooks they pass away;

   ^16Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is
   hid:

   ^17What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are
   consumed out of their place.

   ^18The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and
   perish.

   ^19The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.

   ^20They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and
   were ashamed.

   ^21For now ye are no thing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.

   ^22Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your
   substance?

   ^23Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of
   the mighty?

   ^24Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand
   wherein I have erred.

   ^25How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?

   ^26Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is
   desperate, which are as wind?

   ^27Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.

   ^28Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you
   if I lie.

   ^29Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my
   righteousness is in it.

   ^30Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse
   things?
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 7

   Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also
   like the days of an hireling?

   ^2As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling
   looketh for the reward of his work:

   ^3So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are
   appointed to me.

   ^4When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone?
   and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.

   ^5My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken,
   and become loathsome.

   ^6My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without
   hope.

   ^7O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.

   ^8The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are
   upon me, and I am not.

   ^9As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to
   the grave shall come up no more.

   ^10He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know
   him any more.

   ^11Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish
   of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.

   ^12Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?

   ^13When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my
   complaint;

   ^14Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:

   ^15So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.

   ^16I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are
   vanity.

   ^17What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou
   shouldest set thine heart upon him?

   ^18And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every
   moment?

   ^19How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I
   swallow down my spittle?

   ^20I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men?
   why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to
   myself?

   ^21And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine
   iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in
   the morning, but I shall not be.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 8

   Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

   ^2How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words
   of thy mouth be like a strong wind?

   ^3Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?

   ^4If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away
   for their transgression;

   ^5If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to
   the Almighty;

   ^6If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee,
   and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.

   ^7Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly
   increase.

   ^8For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to
   the search of their fathers:

   ^9(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon
   earth are a shadow:)

   ^10Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of
   their heart?

   ^11Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?

   ^12Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth
   before any other herb.

   ^13So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope
   shall perish:

   ^14Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's
   web.

   ^15He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold
   it fast, but it shall not endure.

   ^16He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his
   garden.

   ^17His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.

   ^18If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I
   have not seen thee.

   ^19Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall
   others grow.

   ^20Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help
   the evil doers:

   ^21Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.

   ^22They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling
   place of the wicked shall come to nought.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 9

   Then Job answered and said,

   ^2I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?

   ^3If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.

   ^4He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened
   himself against him, and hath prospered?

   ^5Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth
   them in his anger.

   ^6Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof
   tremble.

   ^7Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the
   stars.

   ^8Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of
   the sea.

   ^9Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the
   south.

   ^10Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without
   number.

   ^11Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I
   perceive him not.

   ^12Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him,
   What doest thou?

   ^13If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under
   him.

   ^14How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason
   with him?

   ^15Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would
   make supplication to my judge.

   ^16If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe
   that he had hearkened unto my voice.

   ^17For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without
   cause.

   ^18He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with
   bitterness.

   ^19If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who
   shall set me a time to plead?

   ^20If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am
   perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.

   ^21Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise
   my life.

   ^22This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect
   and the wicked.

   ^23If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the
   innocent.

   ^24The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the
   faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?

   ^25Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no
   good.

   ^26They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth
   to the prey.

   ^27If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness,
   and comfort myself:

   ^28I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me
   innocent.

   ^29If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?

   ^30If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;

   ^31Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall
   abhor me.

   ^32For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we
   should come together in judgment.

   ^33Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand
   upon us both.

   ^34Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:

   ^35Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 10

   My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I
   will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

   ^2I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou
   contendest with me.

   ^3Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest
   despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the
   wicked?

   ^4Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?

   ^5Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,

   ^6That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?

   ^7Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver
   out of thine hand.

   ^8Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet
   thou dost destroy me.

   ^9Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and
   wilt thou bring me into dust again?

   ^10Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?

   ^11Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with
   bones and sinews.

   ^12Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath
   preserved my spirit.

   ^13And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is
   with thee.

   ^14If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from
   mine iniquity.

   ^15If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not
   lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine
   affliction;

   ^16For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou
   shewest thyself marvellous upon me.

   ^17Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine
   indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.

   ^18Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I
   had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!

   ^19I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been
   carried from the womb to the grave.

   ^20Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take
   comfort a little,

   ^21Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness
   and the shadow of death;

   ^22A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death,
   without any order, and where the light is as darkness.

    Chapter 11

   Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

   ^2Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full
   of talk be justified?

   ^3Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest,
   shall no man make thee ashamed?

   ^4For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine
   eyes.

   ^5But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;

   ^6And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are
   double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less
   than thine iniquity deserveth.

   ^7Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the
   Almighty unto perfection?

   ^8It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what
   canst thou know?

   ^9The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the
   sea.

   ^10If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder
   him?

   ^11For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then
   consider it?

   ^12For vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's
   colt.

   ^13If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;

   ^14If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not
   wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.

   ^15For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt
   be stedfast, and shalt not fear:

   ^16Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that
   pass away:

   ^17And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine
   forth, thou shalt be as the morning.

   ^18And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig
   about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.

   ^19Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many
   shall make suit unto thee.

   ^20But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape,
   and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.

    Chapter 12

   And Job answered and said,

   ^2No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.

   ^3But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you:
   yea, who knoweth not such things as these?

   ^4I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he
   answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.

   ^5He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the
   thought of him that is at ease.

   ^6The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are
   secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.

   ^7But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of
   the air, and they shall tell thee:

   ^8Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the
   sea shall declare unto thee.

   ^9Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the Lord hath wrought
   this?

   ^10In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of
   all mankind.

   ^11Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?

   ^12With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.

   ^13With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.

   ^14Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth
   up a man, and there can be no opening.

   ^15Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth
   them out, and they overturn the earth.

   ^16With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are
   his.

   ^17He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.

   ^18He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.

   ^19He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.

   ^20He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the
   understanding of the aged.

   ^21He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the
   mighty.

   ^22He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to
   light the shadow of death.

   ^23He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the
   nations, and straiteneth them again.

   ^24He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth,
   and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.

   ^25They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger
   like a drunken man.

    Chapter 13

   Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.

   ^2What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.

   ^3Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with
   God.

   ^4But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.

   ^5Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your
   wisdom.

   ^6Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.

   ^7Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?

   ^8Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?

   ^9Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh
   another, do ye so mock him?

   ^10He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.

   ^11Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon
   you?

   ^12Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of
   clay.

   ^13Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me
   what will.

   ^14Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine
   hand?

   ^15Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine
   own ways before him.

   ^16He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come
   before him.

   ^17Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.

   ^18Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be
   justified.

   ^19Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I
   shall give up the ghost.

   ^20Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from
   thee.

   ^21Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me
   afraid.

   ^22Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou
   me.

   ^23How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my
   transgression and my sin.

   ^24Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?

   ^25Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the
   dry stubble?

   ^26For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess
   the iniquities of my youth.

   ^27Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto
   all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.

   ^28And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth
   eaten.

    Chapter 14

   Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.

   ^2He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a
   shadow, and continueth not.

   ^3And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into
   judgment with thee?

   ^4Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.

   ^5Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with
   thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;

   ^6Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an
   hireling, his day.

   ^7For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout
   again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.

   ^8Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof
   die in the ground;

   ^9Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs
   like a plant.

   ^10But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and
   where is he?

   ^11As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth
   up:

   ^12So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they
   shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.

   ^13Oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep
   me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set
   time, and remember me!

   ^14If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time
   will I wait, till my change come.

   ^15Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to
   the work of thine hands.

   ^16For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?

   ^17My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine
   iniquity.

   ^18And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is
   removed out of his place.

   ^19The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow
   out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.

   ^20Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest
   his countenance, and sendest him away.

   ^21His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought
   low, but he perceiveth it not of them.

   ^22But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him
   shall mourn.

    Chapter 15

   Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,

   ^2Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the
   east wind?

   ^3Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith
   he can do no good?
